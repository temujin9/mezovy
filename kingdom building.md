**Reference:** [Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign - Kingdoms and War](https://legacy.aonprd.com/ultimateCampaign/kingdomsAndWar.html)

## Kingdom Turn Sequence

### 1. Upkeep Phase

- **Determine Kingdom Stability:** 
  - Attempt a Stability check
  - Success: Unrest decreases by 1 (if this would reduce Unrest below 0, add 1 BP to Treasury instead)
  - Failure by 4 or less: Unrest increases by 1
  - Failure by 5 or more: Unrest increases by 1d4

- **Pay Consumption:** 
  - Subtract kingdom's Consumption from Treasury
  - If Treasury is negative after paying Consumption, Unrest increases by 2

- **Fill Vacant Magic Item Slots:** 
  - For settlement districts with buildings that produce magic items (Caster's Tower, Herbalist, etc.)
  - 50% chance once per district with open slot (random selection if more than one)

- **Modify Unrest:** 
  - Unrest increases by 1 for each negative kingdom attribute (Economy, Loyalty, or Stability)
  - Royal Enforcer may decrease Unrest by 1 (must succeed at a Loyalty check or Loyalty decreases by 1)
  - If Unrest reaches 11 or higher, kingdom loses 1 hex (leaders choose which hex)

    - If check fails, vacancy penalty applies for 1 turn
    - Ruler abdication increases Unrest by 2 with -4 penalty on Loyalty check
    - Changing leadership roles within kingdom: no Unrest increase, +4 on Loyalty check

- **Claim and Abandon Hexes:**
  - Hex Claims: 3
  - Can claim formerly claimed hexes with army movement
  - Cost: 1 BP per hex

## Mass Combat Rules

- **Upsize the armies** to make mass combat last multiple rounds:
  - **Mounts (BP = Mount's ACR):** 
    - The army is mounted on horses or other war-trained animals
    - Increase OM and DV by 2, and increase Consumption by 1
    - If mounts are more powerful than units, ACR and derived scores might increase
    - Requirements: settlement must have a Foreign Quarter, Stable, or Stockyard

  - **Ranged Weapons (2 BP):** 
    - Army equipped with ranged weapons (crossbows, slings, bows)
    - Gains ranged attack capability
    - Increases Consumption by 1

- **PC Integration:**
  - PC level 7 = ACR 1/4
  - PC level 10 = ACR 2

- **Naval Combat:**
  - Fortification = hardness + 4 (moats, unsiegable, negated by boarding)
  - Siege engine calculations: 4x would reduce enemy warship to 0 fortification on average
    - Longship: 4 Large
    - Sailing ship: 24 Large
    - Warship: 26/23? Large
  - 15 BP = 60,000 gp (or 7,500 gp?) = 120 (or 15?) light ballista (not counting ammo)
  - Ships can hold any army between crew size and crew + passengers size
  - Usually using Withdraw to stay at Ranged
  - Melee means it's a boarding action
