# Inspirations
- "Her Strong Enchantments Failing" - AE Houseman
  - strong enchantments, towers of fear, limbecks of poison, death curse
- Vasilisa the Beautiful - Russian faerie tale, corrupted
  - "Escaped" from Baba Yaga, married a prince, "kidnapped" by Koschei
  - Staff with skull lantern on top whose light burns/disintegrates enemies
- Morgause - Queen of Orkney, the titular QoAaD from TH White
  - Hates Arthur et al for Uther's crimes
  - Also impunes Merlin as archetype for Rolobo, esp. if conflated with Morgan la Fey
- Galadriel the Ringlord - "All shall love me and despair!"
  - "The Ring's primary power was control over the other rings, including [...] domination of the wills of their users."
  - "Nenya's power was preservation, protection, and possibly concealment from evil."
- Queen of the Fae from Lords and Ladies - glamour, otherworldly, ice land
- The Morrigan - crows, shapeshifting, curses and portents
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morr%C3%ADgan
  - Morrigan Laufeysdottor -> Morgan La Fey
  - Triple sovereignty goddess:
    - battle crow, harbinger of doom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badb
    - land, fertility, kingship, war and horses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macha
    - Morrigu
      or mother goddess (Anand) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu_(Irish_goddess)
      or frenzied havoc of war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemain
  - Compare maiden-mother-crone: Macha-(Morrigu/Anand/Nemain)-Badb
    - Badb is aka Baba Sutemos: Grandmother Shadow, the face given to thieves guilds
    - Macha is the Exilarch of Air, name TBD
  - Mór-Ríoghain: translates great queen, phantom queen, or sea queen (ref to her origin as sea king's daughter)
  - Triune goddess that is a succession of hosts with longevity
    - All just Vasilisa in a new form, backed up by Simulacrum of others which hides when she's about?
    - Others are the two biggest members of her own circle, the Blood and Night hags? 
    - Badb, Macha, Nemain, Anand: names of different aspects (maybe rename Badb to Bryna, meaning raven instead of crow)
- All of the Disney Evil Queens
  - Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty) - fae queen, curses kingdoms for royal snubs
    - There's also the a jealous stepmother in the original story, possibly the original queen mother
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhild the original sleeping beauty
      - Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhilda_of_Austrasia
      - No clear Maleficent equivalent: Odin cursed her for siding against a favorite king of his
  - Queen Grimhilde (Snow White) - jealous of a prince's affection, poisons his paramour
    - Inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_(1935_film)#Plot
  - Yzma - "Snuff Out The Light"
- The Raven Banner 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_banner
  - Originally a Norse thing, referring maybe to Hugin and Munin
  - What does that mean for the old relationship with the dwarves? Was Odin a witch, or was it a kenning for an elven witch advisor?


# Notes
- How old is The Queen and her hegemony? She doesn't have to have been young when she met Rolobo . . .
  - Older explains her investment, her deeper power base, and her slower movement overall
  - How many generations is 1000 years ago for dwarves (25) and elves (9)? 9 human gen ago was 1842, 25 was 1522.
  - More interesting if she conquered Air and Darkness during the interim
- The Queen's end game: ally with Mezovian elements and crush the hobgoblins for their impudence
  - Just reveal her command of them once she's pocketed the Mezovians?
  - This seems to depend on what she knows and when. If she learned recently it might still be in flux.
- The Queen obviously has a poison plant garden
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchineel deadly tree: blistering sap, toxic to attack or burn
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura white flower, hallucinatory/toxic
  - Poppy fields https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Poppies
- New moon for rituals to The Queen
- Was hag bound to Baba Yaga, but graduated a while ago
