SPECIAL ABILITIES

Eye-Rake (Ex)
Any living creature damaged by a murder of crows must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be blinded as the swarm scratches and tears at the victim’s eyes. The blindness lasts for 1d4 days or until healed with remove blindness. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

Share Spells: The wizard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on himself. A wizard may cast spells on his familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the familiar’s type (magical beast). An infiltrator can share only divination spells that have a target of “you” via this ability.

Empathic Link (Su): The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate empathically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link’s limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

Uncanny Stealth (Ex)
An infiltrator gains uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge, treating its master’s level as its effective rogue level.
  She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. She can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Combat) against her.

  She can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (24) than the target does.

Telepathic Bond (Sp)
At 11th level, an infiltrator gains a permanent telepathic bond with its master. This bond has no range limit as long as the familiar and its master are on the same plane.
