Aislinn, Grey Eye of the Sluagh

Relies on lots of undead

Has possessed agents ready to cause trouble

Broke into Auseq, Oreskore, and Uhlinberg earlier

Was aware of Maskar but kept it from Queen
- Why? VPC never gave me guidance there
- Did he eventually hit them himself while PCs weren't paying attention?
- Did he pull Dylan's primary ego from cold storage to do it?

- Dream Scan - mind-read wizards who might know of its existence
- Mind Probe - mind-read wizards who might know of its existence

I realize now that Berko only knows me as 'Aislinn' while Sula does not know that name... And I don't want her to spill the beans about the Sluagh or the Grey Eye. I guess I'll need another name... I'm thinking that the Sluagh are trying to pass as this religious order that's a little creepy but mostly harmless so maybe some religious jargon could do. Low-ranking members would be called "child" or "grey children" while my close circles would go by "grey brother/sister". I don't want to be a "mother" though but maybe something like "the elder" ? I'm also thinking that there is probably an intermediate priestess that gave Sula my instructions in person. 


(Alright my semester is finally coming to a close) Right so I'm not going to let any of these humans live but I'd like to try and set up a ritual to get some of them possessed by spirits to do my biding. I'm not sure how feasable this plan is but I'm willing to break a few minds trying. Knowledge about the wizard towers is good but I'm not sure how to use it yet... It's not like I have an army at the ready. I might try to get another villain on board.
