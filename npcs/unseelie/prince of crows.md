- Vasilisa dumped young Crow upon several schools in turn for magical tutelage
  - How would PCs get this lead?
  - Might be found in the rolls of the mages guilds in question
  - Brought him back once he could cast Permanency, so he's leveled much slower since
  - Might therefore be hundreds of years old, requiring research

- Name is literally "crows" in Scots Gaelic
