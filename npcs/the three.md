The Three: Beshrouded Black (Samvanzu), Brazen Blue (Disla Vencesl), & Mighty Mithral (???)


Black 
- The Black is putting out feelers in thieves guild to Prolichica, Auseq, and Sioraneq territories (with help from Blue on transport)
  - Sending goods through trods to Singuit & Qilissuitsip, pretending it's the company's ship sending them
  - Does this come to Raag's attention?
- The Black is kidnapping familiars, what if they get a witch's? Do they get knowledge of their spells too?
- "flits between marsh hunting grounds and evil monasteries in the mountains"

Blue 
- The Blue is making enquiries about royal flowers to the local magisters in Auseq, Polyn, Daydah, and Topolh guilds
- Disla Vencesl of Auseq (Vagrants) has control of the wizard teleport circles
- Did he create Chained Lightning in this universe?
- "serving as governor of Drakkenhall under geas from Archmage and Emperor"

Mithral replaces Red
- metallic but typically neutral, does lots of bleed, likes mountains and cold?
- The Mithral is exploring the Yutchland mountain-way to Athamberingia
- Sir Not Appearing In This Feature (hopefully)

Others:
- Red dragon? No, the Red and her brood "just got killed by some amoral kids"
- The White is dead at the Lich Kings' hand
  - Lich made a https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wyrmwraith/ with it
  - This helped touch off the Giant-Dwarf war, and may have been due to the Queen's meddling to allow that
  - The PC's dragons are his spawn, could easily have become white instead
- Green is captive of the Elf Queen
  - What poisonous horrors has She wrought from the broods?

Notes:
- Initial meeting spawns kobold traditions, esp. amongst the monks
- All dragons are cousins: types happen after birth, and are more Lamarkian and less morally-connected
  - This means the unhatched eggs from Cirothe could become golden dragons
