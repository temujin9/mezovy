Plotting to get made heir: how would they accomplish this?
- Can't bully the Tzarina, must ingratiate instead
- Set up their siblings for failure without getting directly implicated
- Mostly feeds information to the Queen
- Willing to sacrifice pawns to keep up appearances
- Has something like Amulet of Proof that protects against alignment detection
  - May also be a Vigilante?
