# Inspiration
- Dylan wanted an Alter Ego
- He was part of the ghoulluminati, who are reacting how to The Queen
- He was captured and mind-altered by the Prince of Crows



# Build options
- Anatoli the Alter is cross-blooded Efreeti / Bronze Dragon (weird)
  - What does this imply about Abstemious? Elementalism as a core thing: Conjuration focus?
  - Summon lots of elementals to do your dirty work
  - Some summoning ritual could explain Dylan's creation

- Dread ghast
  https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/dread-ghast-cr-2/
  Undead explains Dylan's lack of Progenitor Dependence
  +2 CR is fine, CR 20 vs this party will be barely difficult

- ~~Abstemious is an astral dragon blood arcanist~~
  Confusing mishmash of concepts that doesn't match Dylan's character well?
  Psychic could explain Dylan's creation in the first place, but so could others
