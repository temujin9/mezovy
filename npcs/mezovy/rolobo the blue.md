Rolobo the Blue
Ice/abjuration wizard extraordinaire


I swear to god I didn't start this with the "blue blood" pun in mind

Blue thrush familiar - +3 Diplomacy, talks
Father of the kingdom, via cuckolding founding king (w/ magic)
Also father of Vasilisa's son (Wizard cohort)
Killed and soul-trapped by Vasilisa at their last encounter
Soul gem is in a tree in out of the courtyards of the Ice Palace
