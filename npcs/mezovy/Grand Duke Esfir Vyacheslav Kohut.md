- Met PCs on boat to second spring ball
  - Learned about everything save dragon, bartender (Quark), flowers left for Queen, etc.
  - Substantiates everything, learning about dragon's front company, dealings with Quark
  - PCs asked for second contact with goblin rebellion, of course he has subtle ways to make that happen
