"The Axe of Perun"


Source: Gallow's backstory

Due to Vasilisa's incursions, there is long-standing fear and hatred of arcane magic in the lands, especially those closest to her original mortal domain. This emerges most readily in this ancient witch-hunter cult, whose traditions is not above torture and murder to "cut down all the depredations of fiends, goblins and foul witchcraft". These days they include any form of arcane magic in that, especially by weird people they don't like.

Currently just a bunch of local yokels carving axe-head tokens out of wood. As the war ramps up, so will these fuckos. Ironically well suited to help resist against the larger problem, but also mostly Lawful Evil (Perun is LN) and fucking mean.
