Leader of Morilorian Occultism

Plans to become a dread lich 
- A dread lich can also make another nonliving creature, except another dread lich, as its phylactery via the use of powerful magic such as wish or miracle.
- Mushrooms count as undead enough for this purpose.
- "You cannot kill me in any way that matters."
