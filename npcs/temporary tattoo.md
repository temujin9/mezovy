- Fine Construct
- Fluid Form (Su): A tattoo guardian does not provoke attacks of opportunity because of movement. It is immune to critical hits and sneak attacks, and it cannot be knocked prone or grappled.
- Hypervigilant (Su)
  A tattoo guardian gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Reflex saves, and it always acts on the surprise round.
- Worn Form (Su)
  While being worn, a tattoo guardian occupies the same space as its wearer and moves with its wearer. In this state, the wearer and the tattoo guardian use the higher of the wearer’s and the tattoo guardian’s AC (ignoring size modifiers) and saving throws, but the tattoo guardian loses access to its fluid form ability.
- Immune construct traits:
  - No Constitution score. Any DCs or other Statistics that rely on a Constitution score treat a construct as having a score of 10 (no bonus or penalty).
  - Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).
  - Immunity to bleed, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.
  - Cannot heal damage on its own, but often can be repaired via exposure to a certain kind of effect (see the creature’s description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat. Constructs can also be healed through spells such as make whole. A construct with the fast healing special quality still benefits from that quality.
  - Not subject to ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, or nonlethal damage.
  - Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
  - Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less.
  - A construct cannot be raised or resurrected.
  - A construct is hard to destroy, and gains bonus hit points based on size, as shown on the following table.
  - Constructs do not breathe, eat, or sleep.
- Bodyguard: Whenever the tattoo guardian’s wearer takes damage, half of the damage is transferred to the guardian (as shield other). Additionally, the tattoo guardian gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against any creatures that damaged its wearer in the previous round.

Rogue 1 (Rake)/Sorcerer 4 (Bloodless)/Arcane Trickster 10
- Spells: 9/5/5/4/4/3/2/1 known, */6/6/6/6/6/5/3 cast (spells as Sorcerer 14th, CL 15)
- Sneak Attack +7d6
- Weapon Finesse
- Bravado’s Blade (Ex): When a rake hits an opponent and deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo 1d6 points of that damage and make a free Intimidate check to demoralize the foe. For every additional 1d6 points of sneak attack damage she forgoes, she receives a +5 circumstance bonus on this check.
- Eschew Materials
- Resonant Body: At 1st level, whenever a bloodless sorcerer casts a spell with a range of personal, increase the duration of the spell by 50% (minimum 1 round). This bonus does not stack with the increase granted by the Extend Spell feat.
- Self-Repair (Ex): At 1st level, a bloodless sorcerer may heal herself of 1d4 + ½ her Charisma modifier in points of damage as a standard action. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.
- Magical Attunement: A bloodless sorcerer casts all sorcerer spells at +1 caster level. This increases to a +2 bonus to at 9th level and +3 bonus at 15th level.
- Malleable Magic: At 3rd level, the bloodless sorcerer may choose any single spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list to add to her spell list for the day while concentrating to regain spell slots. This spell may be changed to a different spell each day.
- Ranged Legerdemain (Su): An arcane trickster can use Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. She can only use this ability if she has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.
- Impromptu Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack she makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack). At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.
- Tricky Spells (Su): Starting at 5th level, an arcane trickster can cast her spells without their somatic or verbal components, as if using the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats. Spells cast using this ability do not increase in spell level or casting time. She can use this ability 3 times per day at 5th level and one additional time per every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5 times per day at 9th level. The arcane trickster decides to use this ability at the time of casting.
- Invisible Thief (Su): At 9th level, an arcane trickster can become invisible, as if under the effects of greater invisibility, as a free action. She can remain invisible for a number of rounds per day equal to her arcane trickster level. Her caster level for this effect is equal to her caster level. These rounds need not be consecutive.
- Surprise Spells: At 10th level, an arcane trickster can add her sneak attack damage to any spell that deals damage, if the targets are flat-footed. This additional damage only applies to spells that deal hit point damage, and the additional damage is of the same type as the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw to negate or halve the damage, it also negates or halves the sneak attack damage.

- Arcane Endowment: Clandestine Arcana (Ex): The spells you cast are much harder for foes to notice or react to. When you cast a spell, as a free action you may make a Spellcraft check. The result of this check replaces the normal DC of any observers’ efforts to determine what spell you are casting with their own Spellcraft checks. Additionally, when you cast spells with non obvious physical effects, targets must make a Perception check equal to your Spellcraft check in order to realize a spell has been cast on them, even if they make their save against the spell.
