# Pick a backstory
The Treasurer witch knows the value of the library
- Are they (he and minor rakshasa familiar) aligned with the witchlords? 
- Probably not, or the PCs would already be fuckered
- Unless he had no idea what he was getting in there, and/or hasn't admitted his failure
- So they are part of a Thieves' Guild, maybe? Which one? One who's pocketed a wizards guild?

Did the Codex go off, and if so who did it, and why?
- Hobgoblins, looking to get out from under the thumb of the hags?
- Is the old Treasurer working for the goblins? Does he succeed in getting the Codex?
- Who does the work of the ritual? Is the Treasurer part of an rebel changeling coven ala the Tokra?
