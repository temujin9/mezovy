Armies:
- 30k-180k = Genghis Khan's armies, roughly
  - A single tumen (5-10k) is roughly two steps beyond "colossal" in Pathfinder terms
  - Actually ten huge/gargantuan armies with a shared command structure
  - first Western Xia - 30k vs 270k
  - first-second Poland - 8k/30k vs 8k/15k
  - Kwarizm - 75k vs 40k
  - second Western Xia - 180k vs 300k
- Ukpik's followers can also lead armies without direct Leadership, because they're not Vile
  - Have each running a squad: 220/22/11/5/3/2/1
  - 11000 = (5+3+2+1)*1000, (77/22/11)*100 squads
  - 12800 = 7800+1200+800+800+600+1600 ~= Queen's followers, total
- Do real calculations for force size
  - Should be enough that their continued growth is a threat to the elves
    - Not enough that a direct confrontation right now would be winnable
    - She's got the edges of preparation, entrenchment, and more equipment
  - Should also be enough that they're a danger to Mezovy
    - Early advantage goes to Ukpik, who has a novel-trod highway for armies
    - These conquests may allow him to swell his armies with human troops?
  - Knowing the size of all forces makes it fairer in terms of PC info
