# History
Cossacks who rebelled against Mezovy a while ago
- How long?
- Second more recent war, caused the zones and "Vogovan X" regions that are on the map
Most recently absorbed Yutchlands after their rebellion against the Queen


# Magic
- How much witchcraft do the Vogovo know? How much wizardry?
- Mezovy was preeminent in wizardy, once, but now it's stalled (fae interference)
- Witchcraft traditions far more widespread, also diffuse
- Cossacks are less likely to adopt more settled lifestyles, probably keep with witches
- Vogovans were Mezovian at one point
- Ergo, Vogovans have a bit of both, but more witches and maybe less animosity (since it was rebels that joined Mezovy)


# Inspiration
- Pratchett: Lords & Ladies, Wee Free Men, etc.
  - Tradition of secretive anti-hag witchcraft
  - Singing/dancing to distract fae creatures
  - Greebo in a box homage => fae cat witch familiar
  - Other fae "waiting out" humans in realms => Compoundia etc
    - Could counter her forces, if they could be convinced, with "I'll kill the portal" being a good threat
  - Scumble
  - Skill-based magic (e.g. Jason Ogg's Profession: Farrier)
  - Feegles
