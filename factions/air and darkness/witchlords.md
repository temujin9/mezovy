# Armies:
- 17k/50k
- Loyalists: ala Ireland during 1798 rebellion - 50k, peak of 4.7M population / 3 = 17k
- Iron Age Celtic pop ranged 2-30M / 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppidum#cite_note-McIntosh-36
  - Average translates to 50k troops from 5M pop (swing is from 20k to 300k)
  - 33K conscripts
- Followers: 12800 ~= 7800+1200+800+800+600+1600
- Vile gives penalties (how much?) to Loyalty checks if not a Follower
- Got the edges of preparation, entrenchment, more equipment, and subversion
- This subversion may allow her to swell her armies with human troops
