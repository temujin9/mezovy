- Have hobgoblins cracked the mother-draught yet? They have a high level chemist among them, but doing so without alerting the witchlords will be hard. They must have, for their numbers to swell. OpSec around it is high, and incomplete. Recipe requires hag's blood, though changeling blood can substitute. No such thing as a goblin changeling.



# Inspirations
- [Yassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yassa)
  - Mongolian secret law, freedom of religion, succession at kuraltai, no peace w/o submission, army rules, great hunt, etc.
  - Important if the PCs want to negotiate peace: the hobgoblins won't accept what the Tzarina would offer
- Stargate
  - Jaffa => Hobgoblins - Uplifted weaker race for mass violence, on the verge of escape
  - Free Jaffa => Ukpik if he gets free of The Queen
- Deep Space 9
  - Jem Hadar - hobgoblins

# Armies:
- 8k/9k now, 25-60k later, peak of 3.7M population
- ala Genghis - 20-30k now (Mohi & Western Xia), ~75-180k (Kwarizm & Xia II) peak of 110M population / 3
- Early advantage goes to Ukpik, who has a novel interplanar highway for armies
- These conquests may allow him to swell his armies with human troops
- 60% cavalry archers/40% heavy cavalry
- Followers: 264 = 220/22/11/5/3/2/1
  - 7th has a larger tumen (colossal core army, 2k, plus 1k from 8 zuut, 20 aravt, 20 spies)
  - Five 5th-6th each have a tumen (colossal core army, 2k, plus 800 from 6 zuut, 20 aravt, 16 spies)
  - 38 2nd-4th have a zuut (medium army, 100), often 2 or 5 merged (large or huge army, 200-500)
  - 120 1st have a aravt (diminutive army, 10), usually 10 merged with zuut (large army, 200)
  - 100 1st are spies (usage/rules TBD)
  - 3x headed to Rovenk (7th, 6th, 5th, 8.6k), 3x conquering trods (6th, 2x 5th, 8.4k)
- Tribes:
  - Elite beast-riders ride individualized monstrous stuff TBD
  - Ulus: ride horses
    - The most common of the hobgoblin types, as they have the most land space to grow in
    - Immiscible w/ goblins: "few things inspire their wrath more than \[...\] horses (who frighten goblins tremendously)"
    - Treat non-horse-riders as conquered levies (e.g. Xia chinese), not main part of troops
    - They gain the most benefit from some Mongol tactics (long march, live off land, looting horses)
  - Inuk: ride dire wolf & bat ("Wooooolf! BAAAAATS!")
    - Several other groups have taken up the bat, for air support and to imitate Ukpik
  - Nawatli: ride axe-beaks
  - Wargs: troops in their own right, only carry goblins
  - Goblins: ride goblin dogs
  - Goblin-borne hobgoblins and bugbears: usually avoid horses, picking up other tribes choices
