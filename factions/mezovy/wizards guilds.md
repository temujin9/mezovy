# Wizards Guilds
- Most have specialties, few are exclusively so
- Most are semi-rival, esp. with Royal guild
- All were once military, but have gone soft in peace (exception is Royal)
- Still have the obligation to service, which the Queen will use
- Collective name is "The Nine Towers", despite there being ten: the Royal is new and nobody is making room
- Somewhat gelded by fae influence: they have no Portal magic to speak of, nor Ipsissimi
- Records of the goblin, his old teacher, and maybe the prince of crows
- Teleport Circles
  - How wizards get armies around if a Tower isn't convenient

## Royal Wizards Guild (Minech)
- aka Cannon Fodder
- dislikes Hart halflings, dislikes Royal Wizards, loves Royal Wizards, loves Nepan Thieves Guild
- Leader: High Magister Rodion Kuznetsov
  - From a cadet branch (the Tarasova Kuznetsovs, after Anzhelina Tarasova Kuznetsov)
- Rosla Castle: This small walled castle has reinforced stone walls with towers, and a large keep. The male lord of the castle is a lazy knight (actually magus) named Lord Koldan Rosla, who has been secretly gathering an army of half-orcs and half-ogres.
- Spell-trigger Symbol of Scrying + Permanence, 1/day (34K): creates Calling Card below, still needs components
  - Including cost of Permanence in printer (144K) would make this *very* powerful
  - Calling Card (Permanent Symbol of Scrying): cheapest (11K), only works for caster
  - Rules
    Until it is triggered, the symbol of scrying is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of scrying must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of scrying ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of scrying works normally.
    Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of scrying with a Spellcraft check (DC 15). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
    A symbol of scrying can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of scrying. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of scrying is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
    When triggered, it creates a scrying sensor linked to you and centered on the symbol, even if you are on a different plane than the symbol. You are immediately aware that the symbol has been triggered if you are conscious, and are awakened from normal sleep if sleeping. The symbol does not otherwise disturb your concentration. You may observe the area through the symbol as if using a scrying spell with the sensor as the target creature. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
    You can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).

To remedy this issue, they created the Gutter's Court, a seperate, less powerful court then their own, composed of remarkable peasants that have demonstrated an above average level of loyalty to their respective feudal leader. These peasants are recruited by their feudal lords to handle menial administrative duties as well as provide an additional layer of contact between the nobility and the commoners. The Court is also a tool used for a less innocent purpose. Due to the chosen peasants being the lowborn representatives of their lords, any issues that the lords have with one another are typically resolved through violent retaliation directed towards their proxy. Chosen peasants often make their own plots to seize power in the Gutter's Court, and exceptionally prominent ones may even be taken into their lords house.
