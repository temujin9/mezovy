# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository contains campaign notes for a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) campaign called "Mezovy" using the Pathfinder system. It is primarily a collection of Markdown files organizing campaign information including:

- Adventure logs and scenarios
- Character information (PCs and NPCs)
- Faction details
- Location descriptions
- Kingdom building rules and mechanics
- House rules
- Campaign history and lore

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

- `/adventures/`: Contains numbered adventure logs and session notes
- `/factions/`: Information about different factions in the world (organized by region/group)
- `/house rules/`: Custom rules for the campaign
- `/locations/`: Details about important places in the world
- `/npcs/`: Non-player character information (organized by affiliation)
- `/pcs/`: Player character information

## Working with the Repository

### Editing Guidelines

1. **Markdown Formatting Preferences**
   - Focus on structural improvements to Markdown without changing the content
   - Convert raw URLs to Markdown links: `[Link Text](URL)`
   - Use proper heading hierarchies: `#`, `##`, `###`
   - Don't add emphasis (bold, italics) to text that wasn't already emphasized
   - Some files may be too complex to edit all at once - focus on one file at a time
   - Don't rewrite text content when formatting - preserve the original wording
   - Some files (like notes.md) are intentionally messy and should be left alone

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Adventure files follow a numerical pattern with descriptive titles (e.g., "001 - clear the castle.md")
   - Character and location files typically use simple, descriptive names
   - Nested directories are used to organize related content

3. **Content Organization**
   - When adding new content, follow the existing organizational structure
   - Place new adventures in the appropriate numbered sequence
   - Organize NPCs and factions by their affiliations in the proper subdirectories

4. **Privacy Considerations**
   - This repository contains campaign notes that may include spoilers
   - Content is intended for GMs and invited participants only

### Best Practices

1. **Cross-References**
   - When referencing characters, locations, or events defined in other files, try to be consistent with naming
   - Consider linking to related files when appropriate

2. **Game Mechanics**
   - The campaign uses Pathfinder rules with custom kingdom building mechanics
   - Refer to the kingdom building files for specific rules and procedures
   - House rules are documented in the dedicated directory

3. **Campaign Timeline**
   - Adventure files are numbered sequentially and represent the campaign's chronology
   - When working with campaign events, maintain this chronological sequence
