# The Sundown Lands
Like many powerful fae folk, Vasilisa has created a large array of interconnected fae realms with Create Demiplane. Not being able to cast Permanency herself (and not knowing the ancient ritual magic version), she has been forced to rely on enchanted wizards -- including the original Rolobo -- and what scrolls she could get hold of over the years. Being chaotic evil and sadistic has made it harder for her to rely on either, which is why she's trained her son by Rolobo to be a wizard. His efforts have improved the output, but it still grows slowly, and takes a lot more toil than she likes. Fae and goblin folk don't stop breeding, and even with abundant food provided, they stack up quickly (breeding is quadratic, but effort from Create Demiplane is linear, and can't be delegated).

Typical Planar Traits
- CL 50 Create Greater Demiplane: 1000 10f cubes, 22500gp (5BP)
  10ft cube => 1000cf => 1 person
  20 x 50 10ft cubes = 1000 cubes => 1,000,000cf => 1000 people
- Light: dim (foggy)
- Bountiful: overripe fruit, honeybee nests, fattened prey animals everywhere (supports up to 1000 people per expansion)
- Morphic: allows the Queen to cover and uncover Portals easily
- Shape: self-contained (disorienting mists return you to opposite side)
- Time: timeless
- Portal: many, mostly to other Fae realms, some to Material Plane

New Construction:
- Using a massive asteroid in the plane of Air as core of operations
  - Goblins live mostly underground there, drow rule from the evergreen forests
  - Queen's tower is in the center of an city in an impact crater, with the windows to Goblin Quarter blocked
- One massive 4hr ritual w/ 27 witches
- 1000 yrs x ~12 lunar months = ~12,000 castings
  - Could have supported ~12M people if most castings had gone to added space
  - Could have done more with both half-moons and 2x time, could have done less at beginning, etc.
- Most castings make L3 trods, instead?

Old Construction:
- One massive 4hr ritual w/ 27 witches
- 5x CGD per plane, +1 / portal or expansion
- The Queen became a Tim Ferris fan (4 hr work week) and Google groupie (20% personal project time)
- 100 yrs x 50 wks x double-time = 100,000 castings (80,000 for minions, 20,000 for self)
  - 10,000,000 10f cubes => 10,000,000,000 cf => 100ft ceiling, 10,000ft (2mi) on a side
- Most castings (80%) just go expand an existing plane, remainder to Portals
- 3/4 of lands go to drow (60,000 castings), leaving goblins understandably dissatisfied (20,000 castings)
  - Each of the twelve witchlords has their own vast demesne (~250 castings apiece, 196k pop cap, 49 portals)
  - Minor witchlords command smaller demesnes (~120 realms, ~25 castings apiece, 16k pop cap, 4 portals)
  - Goblins have one gigantic mental market/labyrinth (~3.2M goblin pop cap, 399 portals)
- Can support ~7.4M population altogether, compare 4M for Mezovy
  - Only ~4.2M is on drow side, compare ~3.2M goblins & hobgoblins
  - Drow are probably outnumbered by their own slaves 4:1 => ~840k drow, ~3.4M slaves


## The Autumn Palace
Vast, magnificent and unapproachable jewel. All windows to the "northwest" have been covered from the inside. Actually several nested demiplanes, where the windows are gates into the larger realm (and sometimes elsewhere). Lord Hob (the Hearth Witch) secures and protects these realm for her at all times.

Planar Traits
- as Typical Planar Traits, plus
- Alignment: mildly Chaotic Evil (-2 to lawful/good charisma checks)
- Energy: minor positive dominant (fast healing 2, undead take 1d6/rnd)
- Structure: self-contained (massive castle with redirecting passages)
- Magic: enhanced (fae magic)
- Time: add double-time

Construction:
- 10x CGD before portals
- Half cost (1000 castings) is planes, half is portals
- 100 planes, 1000 portals
- Lord Hob and the Forgotten Prince both live here too

Inspirations:
- Ice Queen's palace from Narnia
- Elf Queen's lands from Discworld

## The Queen's Woods
Gorgeous airy woods to the "east" of the Ice Palace. Her strongest drow nobles make their homes there, perpetually angling for added lands to buffer from one another and from the goblins, and added Portals to the mortal realms.

The winding main road through the woods to the palace is its own demiplane, with each estate connecting to it via an ornamented portal. Drow patrol this area regularly.

## The Goblin Markets
To the "west" of ice palace, the Goblin Markets are absolutely stuffed with fae and goblin folk looking for a way up and out. Even internally they are an semi-accidental labyrinth, on account of the overstuffed construction. Comparatively warm, from bodies and fires and lack of airflow. Mushrooms grow everywhere in the dank flickering.

The vast surface of the markets is its own demiplane, where many of the portals from the goblin demiplanes originate.

Inspirations:
- Labyrinth
- Kowloon Walled City
- Cyberpunk 2077

## Towers of Fear
Greater Create Demiplane (plus an Instant Fortress?)
- Inside is created first, following by Faerie gate
- Made with a Witches' Sabbath, making it large and very hard to dispel
- Gate to the Abyss requires a coven of Night Hags to open their home (ergo lower CL, because they lack Coven hex)
- Gate to the Material requires a local coven to open their home (also somewhat lower CL, since they're smaller)
Gates at base to Abyss
Gates at top to Faerie, Abyss
Spellcasters at top have powerful advantages on folks at base
