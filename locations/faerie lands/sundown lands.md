# The Sundown Lands
Like many powerful fae folk, Vasilisa has created a large array of interconnected fae realms with Create Demiplane. Not being able to cast Permanency herself (and disliking the time-intensive ancient ritual magic version), she has been forced to rely on enchanted wizards -- including the original Rolobo -- and what scrolls she could get hold of over the years. Being chaotic evil and sadistic has made it harder for her to rely on either, which is why she's trained her son by Rolobo to be a wizard. His efforts have improved the output, but it still grows slowly, and takes a lot more toil than she likes. Fae and goblin folk don't stop breeding, and even with abundant food provided, they stack up quickly (breeding is quadratic, but effort from Create Demiplane is linear, and can't be delegated).

Typical Planar Traits
- CL 50 Create Greater Demiplane: 1000 10f cubes, 22500gp (5BP)
  10ft cube => 1000cf => 1 person
  20 x 50 10ft cubes = 1000 cubes => 1,000,000cf => 1000 people
- Light: dim (foggy)
- Bountiful: overripe fruit, honeybee nests, fattened prey animals everywhere (supports up to 1000 people per expansion)
- Morphic: allows the Queen to cover and uncover Portals easily
- Shape: self-contained (disorienting mists return you to opposite side)
- Time: timeless
- Portal: many, mostly to areas in Air and Darkness, some to Material Plane (thanks to the Welcoming)

Construction:
- Using a massive asteroid in the plane of Air as core of operations
  - Goblins live mostly underground there, drow rule from the evergreen forests
  - Queen's towering palace overlooks the goblin city in the massive impact crater, with the windows facing it blocked
  - Other side has the towering gatehouse to the Deep Woods, forcing supplicants from there to walk garden path to reach the Palace
  - Looks like a verdant crescent moon from the side and at a distance, with the crater forming the concavity?
  - Since this is obviously a Munchausen reference, I need flying heads on saucers for some reason.
- One massive 4hr ritual w/ 27 witches
- 1000 yrs x ~12 lunar months = ~12,000 castings
  - Could have supported ~12M people if castings had gone to added space
  - Could have done more with both half-moons and 2x time, could have done less at beginning, etc.
- Larger planes spreads out the base cost of traits
  - Goblin Market: mutable Small passageways in root-like undergrowth, Bountiful nuts and berries from the ceiling, many goblin Portals
  - Deep Woods: connector between the various Demesnes and the moon, with hidden portals to wooded areas in the Plane of Shadow if you wander off-trail
- More planes allows layering, which allows protection against casual Plane Shift
  - Drow Demesnes: awarded to higher witchlords, shaped to their pleasure (via a magic object which an immutable and irremovable part of the plane)
  - Mirror Realm: intentionally confusing/branching, mutable to chose portals at her pleasure
  - The Infinite Palace: matryoshka doll of strange tower-like realms, always leading "upward"
  - The Oubliette: dead magic realm where prisoners (or at least their soul gems) are kept
- More space takes full ritual
- More doors or other traits just takes 4 hours apiece, probably something she'd do anyway





## The Infinite Palace
Vast, magnificent and unapproachable jewel. All windows to the "northwest" have been covered from the inside. Actually several nested demiplanes, where the windows are gates into the larger realm (and sometimes elsewhere). Lord Hob (the Hearth Witch) secures and protects these realm for her at all times. In the center lies the Hall of Mirrors, an especially mutable realm that The Queen uses to visit the nine hundred realms she has personal portals to.

Planar Traits
- as Typical Planar Traits, plus
- Alignment: mildly Chaotic Evil (-2 to lawful/good charisma checks)
- Energy: minor positive dominant (fast healing 2, undead take 1d6/rnd)
- Structure: self-contained (massive castle with redirecting passages)
- Magic: enhanced (fae magic)
- Time: add double-time

Construction:
- 10x CGD before portals
- Half cost (1000 castings) is planes, half is portals
- 100 planes, 1000 portals
- Lord Hob and the Forgotten Prince both live here too?

Inspirations:
- Ice Queen's palace from Narnia
- Elf Queen's lands from Discworld

## The Queen's Woods
Gorgeous airy woods to the "east" of the Autumn Palace. Her strongest drow nobles make their homes there, perpetually angling for added lands to buffer from one another and from the goblins, and added Portals to the mortal realms.

The winding main road through the woods to the palace is its own demiplane, with each estate connecting to it via an ornamented portal. Drow patrol this area regularly.

## The Goblin Markets
To the "west" of Autumn Palace, the Goblin Markets are absolutely stuffed with fae and goblin folk looking for a way up and out. Even internally they are an semi-accidental labyrinth, on account of the overstuffed construction. Comparatively warm, from bodies and fires and lack of airflow. Strange fruits grow everywhere in the dank flickering.

The vast surface of the markets is its own demiplane, where many of the portals from the goblin demiplanes originate.

Inspirations:
- Labyrinth
- Kowloon Walled City
- Cyberpunk 2077

## Towers of Fear
Greater Create Demiplane, plus a single-use Instant Fortress for visual effect
- Inside is created first, then doors, then antimagic
- Gate to the Abyss requires a coven of Night Hags to open their home (ergo lower CL, because they lack Coven hex?)
- Gate to the Material requires a local coven, etc to open their home (also somewhat lower CL, since they're smaller?)
Gates at base to Abyss/Material
Gates at top to an outer courtyard of the Autumn Palace
Attackers at top have powerful advantages on folks at base

Next time: 
- Made with a Witches' Sabbath, making it large and very hard to dispel
- No antimagic inside, but plenty of protection against demons climbing into elven realms
- Better Instant Tower with more ground exits, etc
- Better protective detail for the Instant Tower
- More than one exit / physical plane Tower?
