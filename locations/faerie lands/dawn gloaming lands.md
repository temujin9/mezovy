Ukpik's goblin wizard cohort discovered how to build plane-making items half a century ago, and has been quietly building on his own from deep in the markets. These lands are small and isolated but bountiful, and used in the raising of Ukpik's hobgoblin armies. This was discovered recently by The Queen, and is why Ukpik has been forced to make his excursion against Mezovy recently.

Unlike the Queen's lands, the limiter here has been money, not work bandwidth. For story balance's sake, Queen caught them before they became enough to threaten her power directly.
