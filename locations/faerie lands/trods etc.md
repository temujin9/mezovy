Vasilisa is not the first to find this strategy, and may prior fae lords have created their own hidden worlds. Lots of early attempts to track her down once the PCs figure it out should land elsewhere instead.

# Lawless
These lands lack an inherent ruler, as their creator has died without passing the connection along. (Not even sure there are known means to do so, which means these may be semi-common.) Most survive by being relatively unknown.

# Trods
The oldest abandoned demiplanes become faerie trods: in-between worlds that more powerful fae use as go-between by linking Portals into. Because they are both rulerless and well known, they are less defensible, so few tend to settle them. Instead, the bountiful ones will be the target of hunter-gatherer parties from more defensible realms connected to them.
 
- Biggest limiter to creation is cost, so load up on secondary traits
- Each has a definite backstory
- How many/big trods/portals
  - Lots/small: lower collision chance, implies lots of portals
  - Few: higher collision chance, higher strategic value, maybe fewer portals
- How far-reaching
  - Short: lower strategic value
  - Long: higher strategic value
- Who
  - Ancients, Drow, Pooka, Goblins (recent)
  - other Elves, Dwarves, wanna-be immortals, anyone fleeing Tsar's conquest
- Why are they unknown
  - Not completely unknown - K: Planes at DC 30 (+5 if you're only using Tsarist sources)
  - Most users are cagey about them because humans and collaborators are the enemy
  - Weren't important until invasion, which is why collaborators didn't learn of them
  - Most are old and monster filled, Queen and others indirect through, so not very hospitable
  - The Church has rules against them
    - No dancing in church (don't undo the Portal Lock)
    - The "Old Ways" are diabolism (kinda true, if you count the tithe)

## The Fungal Trods
The oldest, most numerous, and least controlled of the trods are the fungals. They are often sealed and concealed, sometimes beneath Church buildings. They look like circles of mushrooms when inactive, and like pools of fogged water inside when active. Stepping into the ring correctly requires an Acrobatics DC 15 check (-10 if you've learned how) as you Jareth-walk around the lip of the portal. The trod itself is dank and fungal, with many pest fae fighting over the Bountiful contents.

Trods connect to each other as well, forming a network that becomes more and more cave-like and fungal as it progresses, going from "forests favorable to mushrooms" near the Material to "subjective gravity caves covered with gigantic mushrooms" like  Armillaria ostoyae (3.5 sq mi., 35kton mushroom) and Prototaxites (25ft tall, 3ft wide mushrooms).


### Fae-fed
- ate Bountiful for X meals in last month, and failed DC X save (DC +1 for each fae meat meal)
- supernatural affliction, addicted, eat at half or more meals or Sickened
- if you level while fae-fed, you get the Fae/Fae-Touched template instead of your class
- social stigma with humans & demihumans
- also happens to animals which eat sentient fae creatures, resulting in hybrids (ala TMNT) in next generation
- only happens on fungal trods
