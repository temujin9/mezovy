Boon - reroll one roll after it's made, given by gods as an "attaboy"


# Town
Silver Belfry: PCs who have caught the treasurer in his embezzlement, avenged the hobgoblin's murders in her chapel, or returned the gargoyle may pray to her and receive a boon.

## Random People
1     Relatively unscathed
2-4   Lost most possessions
5-6   Lost all possessions
7-10  Lost a family member, roll again

## Recent News and Rumors
If PCs make any attempt: "The castle has been closed for about two weeks now, and nobody's dared go close. Several of the men-at-arms were seen swimming to shore from the north tower. Before they fled back east, one of them said he'd seen hell. Then the hobgoblins came and we all saw it."

"Clemval ShadbÃ¬ncir, a low-level aristocrat, was to marry Unelle Fanavan at Silver Belfry. Was." (DC 12 Diplomacy)
  This went . . . poorly. "To shreds, you say? And his wife? To shreds, you say?" They're currently half-eaten, up in the castle courtyard.
"Carval Yslantas, a renowned trader, was publicly accused of failing to pay taxes" (DC 15 Diplomacy)
  This poor fellow is currently hanging to the wall in the main prison room. Well, half of him is, anyway. The other half is in the well.
"The Blacksmiths Guild has jailed one of its officers for alleged embezzlement" (DC 18 Diplomacy)
  This poor fellow is currently sitting in the other oubliette, awaiting interrogation and sentencing. He knows both he and Carval are innocent, though he doesn't suspect the treasurer who framed them.
"The annual Corn Festival commences this week, or it should have anyway." (DC 21 Diplomacy)
  Nobody feels like getting this done, but failing to do so will be a morale hit.
"Saw some folks sneak into Garter Battlement. Thought they were up to quick hanky-panky, but they never returned." (DC 24 Diplomacy)
  This was the ratfolk, heading into the castle via the tunnels they'd heard about.
"The ancestors of this lord included a powerful ice mage, which is why it's called The Blue Castle." (DC 25 K. Nobility/History or DC 27 Diplomacy)
There's a Permanent Teleport Trap covering the whole castle, leading to the oubliettes on room 8 of the dungeon level. (DC 28 K. History/Arcana)
The defenses are keyed to the lawful ruler of the castle. (DC 30 K. Nobility/Arcana)
  Having a formal crowning on the throne should do it, but that'll take some PC noodling to figure out.
There's also a custom Permanent spell that makes all cold damage strike like cold iron & silver within the castle grounds. (DC 30 K. History/Arcana)
  This plus the Ice Golems make it a pretty strong anti-evil-outsider protection


# Castle

## Second floor
13 - Chapel of Perun, the high god of spring, east, fertility, atmosphere, thunderbolt, and warrior nobility. PCs who help crown a new ruler of Velerolobo may pray here and receive a boon.

## Basement
4 - Chapel to Radegast, patron of the foot-soldiers, god of hospitality, war, night, and fire. Anyone involved in slaying the Babau may pray at it and receive a boon as gratitude for avenging his faithful.
10 - Cold Storage: enchanted with a Permanent spell that generates ice (and 1 ice golem per year, up to 5, which can't leave grounds)
      Ice Golem: CR 5, XP 1600; N Medium Construct (cold); Init -1; Senses darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +0; AC 17, touch 9, flat-footed 17 (-1 Dex, +8 natural); hp 53 (6d10+20); Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +2; DR 5/adamantine; Immune construct traits, cold, magic; Weak vulnerability to fire; Speed 30 ft.; Melee 2 slams +9 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 cold); SA breath weapon (20-ft. cone, 3d6 cold damage, Reflex DC 13 half, usable once every 1d4 rounds), cold (1d6), icy destruction; Str 16, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1; Base Atk +6, CMB +9, CMD 18
      Golems protect strategic areas in the castle -- Level 1 #13 and #19, basement #3 and #16, and the roof -- in event of mystic alarm.
27 - All books in an ancient and cryptic version of Dragonic (Linguistics DC 35 to read, -10 if you already know Draconic). With time and effort an arcane spellcaster could extract useful knowledge from the books here, but they are experimental logs: the spellbooks themselves sold centuries before to fund a profitable family expedition. They're also worth a small fortune -- 50+ BP -- to the right collector (DC 35 K. Nobility to have heard rumors, DC 25 Appraise/K. Nobility/K. Arcana to recognize their inherent value).

## The 4th Gatetower
Not yet on any map
XX1 - the well-hidden and blocked passageway to the fourth tower, which is underground and surrounds a locked and sunken fey ring
  - Fey Ring => Stargate
  - Stone circle is like the iris
    - Basis of the Teleport Trap and Private Sanctum rituals, also hidden in architecture of Castle Blue and the Capital
    - This is what makes it easy to restore: uses super-expensive, super-durable, hard-to-move Focus
    - Known circle was a site of the last battle of Rolobo and Vasilisa, and both the Ring and Trap spells destroyed
    - Still works for lesser rituals, because not all of the Focus was destroyed
XX2-5 - the four well-hidden Focuses for the various Rolobo Rituals, buried beneath each tower
XX6 - the Oubliette, focus of bigger Teleport Trap

## Library of Rolobo
- Dole these out in bits and pieces, over several sessions (those already given are struck-through)
  - Linguistics checks to read Ye Olde Commone: cluck tongue at "failures", and give one more bit
  - All water damaged, everything requires extra time to read or copy
  - Most of the bindings disintegrated, leaving the sheets loose
  - Mending will clean them up, but doesn't understand page order
  - Between the original decay and the old treasurer ransacking, quite out of order
  - Allow one roll for each column, one week apiece, separate from your kingdom duties
- ~~DC 0: Renewal for Ritual version of Teleport Trap~~
  - Renewable within places already cast, like the palace grounds (Rolobo laid the foundations)
  - Difficult and time consuming ritual, but not expensive
  - Big enough to cover a structure, not enough to cover a land
- DC 10+SL: Older spellbooks
  - DC 9-: Existing (Ye Olde) cantrip
  - DC 10: A novel cantrip
  - All abjuration, anything with Ice in the name or descriptors
  - Figure rest as for newly 17th level Wizard: 
    - 100% of 4th or below
      - ~~Hold Person~~
    - 90% of 5th
      - Cold Iron Fetters
      - Fabricate
    - 70% of 6th
      - Ice Crystal Teleport
      - True Seeing
    - 64 7th = 50% of 128
      - ~~Teleport Trap~~
    - 24 8th = 30% of 79
      - Polar Ray (8th)
    - 7 9th = 10% of 71
      - -Mage's Disjunction-
- DC 20+: Rituals (these DCs are not the performance DCs, which should be set separately)
  - ~~DC 20: Permanent Teleport Trap (difficult, time, and expensive: lots of cold iron and silver)~~
    - Can be applied to other castles, etc with time, materials etc. (+X BP)
  - DC 20: Permanent Mage's Private Sanctum (difficult, time, and expensive: lots of cold iron and silver)
    - DC 35 Spellcraft, -5 for each instance of it: huh . . . it seems like the *same* focus could be used for these
  - DC 23: Ice of Mithril and Iron (difficult, time, and materials, +X BP)
  - DC 25: True Seeing (difficult and time consuming but not expensive)
  - DC 28: Earthbound Ward - https://aonprd.com/OccultRituals.aspx?ItemName=Earthbound%20Ward
  - DC 30: Protection From Spells (difficult, 500gp, 1kgp focus per target)
  - DC 35: Permanent Symbol of Vulnerability (time consuming, 40kgp)
- DC 20+: Nearly untranslatable portions contain shorthand-laden journals
  - ~~DC 21: Didn't die childless, also fathered the current Kuznetsov clan via his brother's wife~~
  - DC 21: There was once a fourth gatetower, where "I first met The Lady Fair"
  - DC 22: Rolobo got fucked and dumped by Vasilisa
  - DC 26: Details her basic nature, fae witch enchantress
  - ~~DC 27: Ends rather abruptly, because he stopped updating it when she killed him~~
  - ~~DC 27: The fourth tower was buried to protect Velerolobo~~
  - ~~DC 36: The rituals are actually poorly centered, and could be extended and solidified if the four Focuses are located~~
  - DC 40: Notes about Codex Praestabilis Bruma he's writing, clue to Seryy knowing second key
- Codex Praestabilis Bruma: "The Book of Preeminent Frost"
  - Probably still in order, which is a small blessing
  - In a magical cypher (Secret Page plus plus)
  - Key is in a secret phrase Seryy was taught as a child ("the second sign is the blue blood")
  - Has a ritual that gives SR to *everything* in its area for a fortnight
  - Also causes subzero temperatures regardless of season
  - Would be a massive secret weapon to either side, which is why The Queen wanted it
