Campaign Name: The Longshot
Premise:
- PCs are supporting an NPC contender for the throne of the Tzardom of Mezovy
- Mommy Tzarina just gave each of her kids control of a ruined capital within Rovenkian Dearth
- Intended to make episodic w/ rotating GMs easier

# Enemy Plans
The Lady Fair desires a wedding with Koschei, to advance past hag to full outsider. To this end she has proposed by opening a temporary gate to the Abyss, causing the Dearth while sending a messenger to his court, and promising to open permanent ones as a dowry. She awaits his reply in her island kingdom to the east -- Styerrabrae -- from where she is stirring up trouble with three mortal lords (King Cold, Ukpik, and The Traitor).

She also desires a wedding for her son which will confirm his rightful place as ruler of Mezovy, given his blue blood. This is the ostensible causus belli for the war she's kicking up: failure to invite him to the ball so he might woo a princess. She loves him obsessively and wants everything like this for him, but will throw him over in an instant to preserve herself.

## Advancement
- Each month, each major villain advances plots abstractly by 1d3-1 points (or GM fiat)
- If PCs delivered them a setback this month, no advancement, and -1 points instead
- If the Villain instead got aid from the PCs, normal advancement +1
- At 10 points, have background bad thing happen and subtract 10 points
- This ratchets up the losses as time progresses, but let PCs decide where to focus

- King Cold ravages the northerners

# Endgame
- https://gnomestew.com/how-to-have-an-epic-campaign-in-three-acts-part-3-of-3/
  - Start at about 14th level, aim to run PCs vs. the Queen at 16th level? That's a 50:50 chance if she's -alone-.
  - Bring back memorable NPCs
  - Why did it come to this? Recap the cassus belli, maybe w/ escaped NPCs
  - NPCs start losing hope, to emphasize bleakness of situation
  - Climactic battle needs chaotic setting (larger battle, interesting terrain, etc)
  - Blow something up at the end (the Iceland Palace?)
- Make Vasilisa's retributive strike abilities clear, so PCs know a sacrifice is being called for, keep details hazy
 
# Next
- Moriloran Occultism is run by undead, head of the cult is aiming to make himself a lich with mushroom magic
