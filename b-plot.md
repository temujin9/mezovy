Campaign Name: The Longshot
Premise:
- PCs are supporting an NPC contender for the throne of the Tzardom of Mezovy
- Mommy Tzarina just gave each of her kids control of a ruined capital within Rovenkian Dearth
- Intended to make episodic w/ rotating GMs easier

# Enemy Plans
The Lady Fair desires a wedding with Koschei. To this end she has proposed by opening a temporary gate to the Abyss, causing the Dearth while sending a messenger to his court, and promising to open permanent ones as a dowry. She awaits his reply in her island kingdom to the east -- Styerrabrae -- from where she is stirring up trouble with three mortal lords (King Cold, Ukpik, and The Traitor).

She also desires a wedding for her son which will confirm his rightful place as ruler of Mezovy, given his blue blood. This is the ostensible causus belli for the war she's kicking up: failure to invite him to the ball so he might woo a princess. She loves him obsessively and wants everything like this for him, but will throw him over in an instant to preserve herself.

# Enemies
- Vasilisa: 7
  - Corrupting Mezovy counties to her west
  - Sewing confusion and discord further abroad
- King Cold: 3
  - Advancing from the north
  - Gathering souls for Koschei (in his belly)
- Ukpik: 3
  - Securing the trods
- The Traitor: 9
  - Arrange failure for a sibling
- Koschei (via demons in Rovenk): 5
  - Demolish Rovenk
  - Attack any of the siblings

## Advancement
- Each month each major enemy NPC advances their plots abstractly by 2d4-1 points, unless PCs delivered them a setback (-1 points)
- At 10 points, have background bad thing happen and subtract 10 (or less) points
- This ratchets up the losses as time progresses, but let PCs decide where to focus
- If they run around like decapitated chickens they can thwart 4 of the five every month and stay even over the long term
- That assumes they understand the mechanic and monofocus on it, and I'm not planning to explain

## History
- Rovenk destroyed by demons
- King Cold ravages the northerners
- The Tsareviches are given the ruined lands around Rovenk
- The spring ball is attacked by simulacra and fae familiars, and a threat written in flowers left
- Ukpik raids Rokenk's treasury, the Tzarina's forces recapture the city, Seryy named Tsesarevich


# Endgame
- https://gnomestew.com/how-to-have-an-epic-campaign-in-three-acts-part-3-of-3/
  - Start at about 14th level, aim to run PCs vs. the Queen at 16th level? That's a 50:50 chance if she's -alone-.
  - Bring back memorable NPCs
  - Why did it come to this? Recap the cassus belli, maybe w/ escaped NPCs
  - NPCs start losing hope, to emphasize bleakness of situation
  - Climactic battle needs chaotic setting (larger battle, interesting terrain, etc)
  - Blow something up at the end (the Iceland Palace?)
- Make Vasilisa's retributive strike abilities clear, so PCs know a sacrifice is being called for, keep details hazy
 
# Next
- Moriloran Occultism is run by undead, head of the cult is aiming to make himself a lich with
