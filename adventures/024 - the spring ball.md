# Courtly drama
- All children summoned back to court for the spring ball
- Teleportation provided by royal magister
  Stanimir Radojka Stojanović
- High event of the season, Mother wants a brave face on the Rovenk situation
- Pretty clear this is abnormal from the start
- Kingdom of 4M in 55 provinces (45 non-royal) produces ~400 nobles capable of coming to royal ball (1% of 1%)?
  - Queen's party is 20 people, each of 8 princes brought ~10 => 100 royals
  - Non-royal provinces brought ~10 people per party
  - Simulacrum rate 5% in royals => 1/2 princes had one, already purged
  - Simulacrum rate 15% in nobles => 60 nobles in the ball

# Timeline
- 7:00PM    PCs & Seryy are teleported to the capital, audience with Tzarina, eight hours elapse
- 8:30PM    Evening of ball starts, Queen's attack starts, cacodaemons infiltrating
- 8:40PM    Storm in full force
- 9:30PM    Ballroom Blitz
- 11:00PM   Aftermath

# Private Audience:

- Royal magister has done True Seeing on the princes and their courts already
- Don't give it away ahead of time, to maximize chance of catching them
