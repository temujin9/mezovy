# Phase 2: the trial
6pm to 7pm
- Defenses set up by the Hand and his General
  - Mostly Commoners on patrol, each with a Fighter or Warpriest on patrol
- Inquisitor on their side
  - Fazzal Cienfuegos, ascerbic female Eurabic priest of Chernabog
  - Annalise Keating from How To Get Away With Murder
- Variety of charges: greatest hits of PC's, plus some BS
  - Ignoble associations
    - Gahdri - a foreigner who doesn't know our ways
    - Ragnar and Anatoli - known criminal backgrounds
    - General Mayhem - perpetually masked, out-of-control, and could be fae
    - General Nikita - obviously fae-born, military service is sham
    - Dig at mostly non-human racial composition
  - Failure to safeguard
    - (007) fire snake goblins
    - (013) ice giants
    - (015) undead
    - (045) mad wizard
  - Fraternizing with enemies of man
    - (003) Cold-iron elementals
    - (005) Treasurer in Puryev
    - (020) Uncle Ivan
    - (024) Ballroom blitz
    - (027) Goblin slaves
    - (032) Lamia matriarch
    - (035) kobolds, familiar-napping
    - (043) fae rings
  - (051) defiling a church
    - Investigating undead after clearing demons
  - Death-eating
    - Dismissed easily

Goal is not to execute:
- Wants Ecclesiarchy to have a seat at the table of Velerolobo
- Distrusts any obviously chaotic characters
- Genuinely wants to know why PCs were exposing the ring
- Has a strong nose for fae / hag influence, will find none on PCs
- Will allow testimony under Circle of Truth following a thorough scan for enchantments
- Despite all appearances, will have a fair trial and acquit the PCs of most severe charges
- Will take charges of the existence of a ghoulish cabal with seriousness



# The Tax Farmer's Office
Fix for loss of income due to incorrect calculations
150 BP found in three locations
- old revenue from tax farmers
- 90 BP in Painted Glen (dead tax collector in tax farmer's home)
- 20 BP in Blomadale (handed over readily)
- 20 BP in Falcon's Hollow (the farmer there was hoarding it)
- 20 BP in Hinntown (an NPC rogue had planned to make off with it)



# Notes
## Trod 
L1, covers most of Puryev territory, overlaps with eastern Prolichia, western Velerolobo, ???
Gates:
- Painted Glen ruins, under the church
- SW Velerolobo, from the twin's map
- One nearer to Prolichia than the kobold gate
  - Not koboldy because it's lightly defended and not useful
  - How's it defended?
- 2+ in Puryev, but less useful or previously locked
- L2s/L3 TBD


## Negotiations
- Leader is jovial, treats everyone with politeness
- The red shirts are representing a legitimate grievance with the crown, backed by legal standing.
- The charges against General Nikita will not stick, because she is provably not guilty of death-eating.
- Not directly related to the Axe that attacked Gahdri, will express sadness at that "ill-advised" behavior.
