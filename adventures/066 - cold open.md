PC Plan: Helping dwarves and Uhlinberg wizards in their fight vs the giants

Goals
- Force PCs to choose between secrecy and military size
  - Reward choice to leak the info for more troops: 1st level NPCs show up and do wandering damage, speeding combats
  - Don't punish choice to retain secrecy: nobody's mad that only the vanguard came
- Clues about the death and necromantic conversion of The White
  - Dwarves definitely know of The White's death, and know that the shift in balance of power is to blame
  - They wrongly suspect the hags of orchestrating it, saying there was fell necromancy involved
- Clues in the dwarven hatred of the elves
  - Many elves sided with hags last time
  - Most dwarves won't know the history directly, as it's 25 generations old
  - Assume hag-like, witch-like, and fae-like qualities in insult
  - Turns out they were right, at least about the hags working here
- Clues in the Uhlinberg hatred of the fae
- Clues that The Queen has sided with the Giants
  - Drow poisons? Elven magics? Shadowy spies?
  - Whispers that Laufey-of-the-air and King Cold's King intend marriage? (Sense Motive: This is a kenning, not literal: The Queen and Koschei.)

PC Planning:
- Send PCs via the trods, send NPC armies along the slower route ("Helm's Deeping it")
- Small wizard army, small half-orc army, small halfling ranged

Initial scene is narrative mode curb stomping resistance of a giant invasion on a dwarf stronghold
- Make it clear that 11th level PCs are bad-ass
- Rugov shows up and shows off too
- Give the racist mofos some reason to trust our intrepid adventurers
- A little bit of setting the scene for the main thrust of play

Low King Thror II Vegdrasill

In thick German/Martok accent: "...isch anysing like zee voman I dought I'd marry? She is prideful, arrogant, laufey voman who shares my bed far too ... :notices PCs: Aaaah, you must be ze western elfling ... volk we've heard so much about no? Vell, we're short a few hands, and Rugov vouched for you. Mind the rabble, zey are not so open-minded as I."
- Rugov Konstantinovich is [Lady Frost](npcs/mezovy/lady%20frost.md) from Ep 47
- Sense Motive: that ellipsis is him finding a maybe-non-racist way to express clearly racist feelings against elves
- Can give a thorough briefing on the current situation, not many deep surprises

Splitting the party, splitting the party
- Force PCs to choose between splitting up and losing key objectives that make things harder
- Push on four fronts, separated enough to be inaccessible except by extraneous action (e.g. Dim Door)
  - Fourth will be covered by Rugov and the Dwarf King to get them off the map
- They sent Followers ahead to scout, so this could be result of that 
  - Reward, don't punish: give them info they can use to great advantage if they move quickly on many fronts
  - Giants are laid out in places X/Y/Z, a breakthrough in all three could route them and force them back miles from their current lines
  - Followers are currently holding X/Y/Z awaiting backup, could pull out but would result in massacre of Uhlinberg NPCs
  - Must support or pull out followers or risk casualties
- Could advance the Uhlinberg troops through trods, but that'll get them all het up
  - Any wizards they try to bring along will balk, then don full plague gear for the experience
  - Tread lightly, don't want to sneer at masking lest people take it as metaphor

Each front encounters many smaller battles
- 2-3 PCs per combat
- Preroll all NPC behavior
- Do one round and then move to another group
- If a PC ain't ready, go to another group and then come back
- Ratchet up enemy power (starting *low*)
- Intent is to reward readiness to action, ability to pace self
- Give some final glory to the team which moved the quickest
  - A Positive relationship point with the Dwarf Lord?

Timing:
- 45 min per round is 8 rounds, but more likely to only get it in 6
- If we assume 6 people that's ~5 min a person a round plus same for enemy action, should be doable
- CR -1 overall, but then Easy/Average/Challenging, so CR 9/10/11

# At the four Bridges (CR 9)
Hags will flee if down by 1/3, which increases chance the rest scatter / reinforcements help take them out
PC's realize after the fact that the Dwarf King steered them toward choosing the less "glorious" (difficult) bridges
