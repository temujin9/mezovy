# Plans
- Breather / planning / consequences episode
- The door from The Queen's Woods to The Queen's Garden is locked right now
  - PCs could go around via the market and unlock it
  - Indications are that this locking is just standard procedure in times of upheaval
- The Goblin Market is in simmering revolt following the public execution of Lord Hob
  - The Queen has spun the goblin doors, but strategic and well-hidden hobgoblin doors exist on both sides of the network
  - Rebels have not done a lot of active violence, preferring simply to confuse and sap morale of drow
  - PCs could light the spark here on their way through
- Villains send help
  - Viktor reveals existence of golem army and offers its part as vanguard troops
  - Raag has sent best sneaky folks to protect Seryy's back, but stays behind to protect homeland / retreat
  - Yarik sends offer of mercenary army, elite assassins, and dark knight (golem hunter) to "commanders of the army" in exchange for high pay
- The Prince of Crows has taken his betrothed to his castle in the Abyss
  - He probably intends to have a wedding there despite the illegitimacy
  - He's got troves of books and soul gems to tithe to Kostchtchie there
  - PCs could assault his castle and free them, gaining allies
- Forces and lords in Darkness weakened by the Mad Mage Oilester
  - He has taken advantage of the chaos in Mezovy, raiding Uhlinberg's remains while the PCs fought the demons
  - Also seen in Hart and collecting demons for his own army
  - How lucid is he about the fronts of this war? Can he identify the demon tower as the queen's work? Is he a potential TTPC ally? Who could tell?
- Rumor of the surrender of the eastern front is reaching the lords and armies here
  - The hobgoblins are claiming the eastern lands with alacrity
  - PCs must act fast or this may all fall apart
- Word of The Queen planning a stronger Tower of Fear on top of the central mountain
  - Good place to interrupt her and kick off final pursuit
  - Can be reached (among other ways) from a path in The Queen's Garden


# Meta
- PCs only have so much time, and every optional thing they chose to do costs time
- Each side-quest has bonuses
  - Sparking rebellion: Air falls to goblins, goblins are firmly committed, distracted from eastern Mezovy
  - Prince of Crows: rescuing many lost souls who can now be resurrected for the cause, maybe kill the Prince, maybe catch the Traitor
  - Oilester: he's weird and he's super-dangerous but he can tell hawk from heronsaw, Darkness falls to the urden
- Each step that they pursue advances The Queen's plan by one step
  - 9hr ritual to create CL 50 Demiplane from mountaintop
  - 9hr ritual to create CL 50 Portal to Abyss (immediately locked)
  - 9hr ritual to create CL 50 Portal to Minech
- PCs will arrive just in time to cinematically prevent the step from occurring (8hrs and 55 min into the ritual), unless they've taken all three side-roads


# Next

- 98 - Interrupting the final ritual
- 99 - Pursuing The Queen through her garden
