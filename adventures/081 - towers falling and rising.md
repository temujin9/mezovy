What allies show up to help PCs?
- Ice duelist
  - Emphasize their absolute 1:1 devastation, but lack of unity coherence
  - Want to keep them around but fine to injure severely / kill and don't soul-reap
- Royal Mages
  - Emphasize their tactical unity, the known NPCs bringing active backups
- Church
  - Arrive along with Royal Mages, appear to be at Mage's behest
  - Will be casting Forbiddance (Law) which can hurt PCs too, but takes 6 rounds
- Ask the PCs who else they bring

Who should die?
- Innocents, by the cartload, to emphasize that every delay is costly
- At least one or two meaningful ones, in addition to PC risk
- Every allied death should grant them an opportunity, nobody named dies in vain
- Followers, by the handful
- Cohorts - Neobe, Kostia, Thunder, Koshka
- Friendly NPCs - Duelist, Royal mage advisors, Columbo
  - There's two royal mages, we can afford to lose one
  - Threaten the loss of the duelist to motivate
- PCs 
  - Threatening the portal is marking for PVP, and demons go hard
  - Telepathic shout in Abyssal of "The portal! Get that one!" so everyone knows what's what




Ending news
- Many priceless artifacts and almost all of the students rescued from Uhlinberg, but the tower and town itself are both largely destroyed. Refugees are swarming the towers.
- Sending from Raag: "Drutk Dowager aligned with Exilarchy, firstborn grandchild promised in marriage. Investigating myself, avenge me if not back in fortnight. Enjoy the tarts when they arrive!"
- "I hope this finds you well, in the field, friends. We remain vigilant. Please trust. I've also sent a few fresh fruit tarts. Enjoy!" Signed with a cursive RF. There is a small smudge in the corner, like a bit of a halfling's fingerprint from a jam-smudge.
- Seryy reports that his brother does not appear to have heeded his warnings about his mother-in-law or the elves
