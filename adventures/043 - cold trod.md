PCs try to enter the ring under the fourth tower. First stopped by old teleport trap with unknown key. Replaced that with a new one, covering most of the town, and keyed "get your own millstone". Stepped through, caught by trod-side Teleport Trap and placed next to other circle. Determine likely center of teleport and head back toward it, narrowly avoiding Lost Passage and not triggering the Good-keyed Forbiddance. Found cottage with key to the Teleport Trap underlined, finally returned to Velerolobo.
