Final confrontation with the Queen

Prerequistes:
- Seryy survives to this point. (If not, is it Mayhem? Too close to DMPC?)
- The Queen is a known target, and PCs are pursuing her through her redoubt

Give each PC an opportunity to sacrifice themselves to kill her, if they don't Seryy does. She has used ritual magic to curse her own death, so that it will nigh-inevitably poison her killer. The "break" DC is the same super-high level that the Demiplanes are, the save is the same, and crit failures on the (daily?) save.

If the PCs do nothing:
- Hobgoblin win?
  - The Queen's murder of the heirs and conspiracy with The Traitor is revealed
  - Seryy finds and kills the Queen, dying in the attempt
  - The Tokra (changeling witches) get to and use the Codex 
    - The Codex only works on the Material Plane: other planes still have normal speed magic?
    - The Codex works on all the Inner Planes, but not the Astral or Outer Planes?
    - The Codex works most on Material, some on Inner, none on the Outer?
  - Ukpik conquers Mezovy, in a protracted battle that devastates it
    - If Seryy survives he manages to surrender early, sparing more of it
  - The witchlords hegemony shatters, turning Air & Darkness into feuding warlord states
- Drow win?
  - The artificer is found and murdered
  - The Traitor is named heir
  - Seryy does kill Queen, but her son and the witchlords rule Mezovy & Air & Darkness
