# Plans
Raising the curtain
- Answer everyone's questions about what had been happening
- Have villains on the call too, if possible

Microscope session about what happens next
- Did the Codex go off?
- How else did things shake out?

Design principle: allegory for current events where feasible
- Hobgoblin rule: upheaval of world order as regional stability wanes
- Shattering of spellweb: failure of old (social) systems in the face of tech change?
- Rise of AI: unbinding of magical items / Unchained Lightning scenario

What would a product look like?
- What time era? 
  - Current era has a bolus of information, but is also very path dependent
  - Next generation would allow more input from others
- Game system
  - Pathfinder is super heavy-weight, but is the system we used
  - 13th Age is super-light, doesn't share all of the DNA with Pathfinder
  - Some mix of both? Carry forward the useful bits from Pathfinder into 13th Age?
    - Difference between Wizards and Witches
    - Magic item creation as important plot point
    - Create Demiplane + Ritual Magic for permanence
- Codex Praestabilis Bruma turns magic into ritual only?
  - Turns this into Chosen (Sharpe's + Ars Magica)
  - All magic becomes ritual
    - Only take the spell's usage each round, so other actions are still possible (maybe even fighting, for "quick" spells)
    - d3+1 rounds for quick -> 14+ save 2nd round, 11+ 3rd round, automatic 4th round (preserves mystery if it matters)
    - d4 minutes/quarter-hours/hours -> 16+ save 1st time interval, and then as above (if necessary to preserve mystery)
  - Gather Power works on the next spell, but makes you visible until casting is completed
