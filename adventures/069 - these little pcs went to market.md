The Gang Goes Goblin Shopping
- I get a desired scene: Navigating the ground of the Goblin Market
- Air patrols and Teleport Traps prevent easy egress and exit
- Picaresque at less of an insane clip
  - Plane of Air: heart of the city, built into most of an asteroid with the Queen's Tower on the outskirts (not a Tower of Fear)
  - The Labyrinth: mutable plane for goblins, made by and mutable by The Queen
    - Bountiful by way of strange fruits 
  - Play up the "Bazaar at Deva" format
    - Every surface with room has a stand on it
    - It's like a gigantic flea market, but built for Small characters
    - Anything is available for purchase, but it will take a Gather Information _and_ outright bribery to find
  - Everygoblin Everywhere All At Once: put the trods to shame for breadth and concealment?
    - anywhere there are enough goblins to do a well-received Welcoming of the Gentry, most lead by witches
    - small caves with treasures and boltholes ready for violence

  - Hags come from changelings or drow
  - The hags, changelings, drow, and hobgoblins all follow a Queen who rules multiple realms
  - The hobgoblins have significant reserves they haven't deployed (difficult)
