GM Goals
- Give PCs more confidence in using the trods to their own advantage
- Make it clear that the hobgoblins are using the trods extensively
- Make success or failure important, and possible

PC Plans
- Gallows making magic items

News
- Growing halfling and gnome population on the east side of Velerolobo (minor kingdom building buff)
  - Even greater goblin population boom (minor different kingdom building penalty)
- Uhlinberg has been hit by King Cold, so badly that some are calling it "a second dearth"
- Vogovan troops have crossed the now Vogovan Yutch in the name of Berko, and are pushing the Count Yutush's troops back
- Hobgoblin forces sweep through southern Piekki and Qermerseqeria, blocked in Safik by combined forces lead by Daydah
  - News of the faerie rings travel has broken among the nobles, has been met with derision and hidden fears
  - TODO: PCs send emissaries to the Count of Daydah
    - Missive: Congratulations and offer of assistance from specialists (5th level Bard, 2nd level Cossack, 1st level Rogue)
    - Spy: sticking around and keeping an eye on Daydah (1st level Sorcerer)
- NPC allies of Dylan suggest trying to waylay hobgoblins for their locking tool, to investigate it
- Intel from followers sent out
  - Group that went to return the kid to the mountain village
    - Noticed something weird about how the people reacted to the child's return: happy, but also unsurprised
    - This thing of kids going up the mountain is a yearly thing?
  - Margraves being observed: notes on evidence for traitor prince?
    - Prince Å½arko Yuriy Kuznetsov is marrying Bunina Georgievna daughter of Shulga Georgievna
    - TODO: Is Seryy coming through, will he bring PCs with?

Picaresque episode
- PCs learn a fair bit about the layout of the local planes
  - Blockage of redcap portal was strategic and recently used, to keep pursuers from following the redcaps
  - TODO: Find where the redcaps went, cause devastation
  - Offer this mostly as read: PCs don't need to know, their characters will
  - Random encounters with fae, quick and narrative, most chased away
- PCs encounter Oskari Leskinen, a gnome that uses the trods for trade
  - PCs invite him back to town to trade, tax his transactions

  - PCs get lead to a blocked portal in L2011 that leads to L3004
  - Bluffing about lack of knowledge of kobolds / goblin market
- Reminder of the increasing power of the witchlords
  - The Lamia comes back, looking for revenge and her sword back, dies with the name witchlords on her tongue
  - Reports from all over the country of more fae folk showing up in Material
  - PCs figure out that they're allied with / leading 
- Reminder of the increasing paranoia and fae-hatred of the Church et al?
  - Wild accusations of roughly what they're doing (enchantment by faeries)
  - Dutifully but suspiciously disproven by Perun overseer

Ends in a running pursuit of hobgoblin raiders / scouts
- Starts in L1005 (Izhokia, south of Velerolobo)
- Came from L2013, will retreat that direction
- Want to have meaningful win / fail without completely threatening PCs trod territories
- Ergo set it somewhere strategic and close-by, but not in Faceplant
- The hobgoblins will be set upon Yarik's Carrion Golems, which will also affect PCs
  - Golems have Locate Creature enchanted into them somehow
- 15x hobgoblins on dire wolves, vs 3x carrion golems
