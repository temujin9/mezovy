## Trod 
L1, covers most of Puryev territory, overlaps with eastern Prolichia, western Velerolobo, ???
Gates:
- Painted Glen ruins, under the church
- SW Velerolobo, from the twin's map
- One nearer to Prolichia than the kobold gate
  - Not koboldy because it's lightly defended and not useful
  - How's it defended?
- 2+ in Puryev, but less useful or previously locked
- L2s/L3 TBD

Inhabited by ???
- How hostile?
- Maybe some initially hostile, some implacable
- How do I keep Kat having fun while it's going on

## Negotiations
- Leader is jovial, treats everyone with politeness
- The red shirts are representing a legitimate grievance with the crown, backed by legal standing.
- The charges against General Nikita will not stick, because she is provably not guilty of death-eating.
- Not directly related to the Axe that attacked Gahdri, will express sadness at that "ill-advised" behavior.


# The Tax Farmer's Office
Fix for loss of income due to incorrect calculations
150 BP found in three locations
- old revenue from tax farmers
- 90 BP in Painted Glen (dead tax collector in tax farmer's home)
- 20 BP in Blomadale (handed over readily)
- 20 BP in Falcon's Hollow (the farmer there was hoarding it)
- 20 BP in Hinntown (an NPC rogue had planned to make off with it)
