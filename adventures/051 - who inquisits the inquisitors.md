# Plans
PCs investigate ghoulishness in churches

- Checking out nearby churches

PCs find religious and fae lore:

- The Church is a source of anti-fae lore and practice
- Lots of politics around who's on "the Common Council"
- Church floors often conceal fae rings
  - A former Morilorian church is found wrecked
- Morilorian Occultism should be hinted at but not revealed

  - Knows about the hidden fae circles, controls and uses some hidden ones
  - Circle in Prolichia is a former Morilorian circle
    - they have retreated warily from Samvanzu and her minions
    - the kobolds don't know about them due to their secrecy
  - MO is to stay under the radar by hiding theft of meat from burials
- The Cult of Chernabog should be hinted at but not revealed
  - Seek to raise Chernabog to the Common Council
  - Willing to weaken / destabilize current church to accomplish this
