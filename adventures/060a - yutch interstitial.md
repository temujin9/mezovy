You are brought safely to the court of the Tsesarovich, Seryy Kuznetsov, by his motley crew of retainers. They are pointedly not invited past the threshold of the meeting chamber. You hear protests met with a bald refusal by the guards: "The matter is between the Tsardom and the Yutch. You have your master's word he will not be harmed."

The Ambassador is announced as Sergeyev Vladimir Artemovich, and then more directly introduces himself before launching into a speech:

"You may call me Vova, and I hope I may just call you Diego?"

"Your people present a conundrum, young Diego. We will not pretend that you are not valiant and terrible foes in battle, at least on home ground. The Vogovans sealed the deal for you, but you had nearly fought the Count Yutesh to a standstill by yourself in the mountain pass. Yet your appearance here tells me either that the deal with Vogovo was not to your liking, or that reputation our Tsarina's wrath has reached you and swayed you. Having by some miracle bought the support of Vogovo, you now propose to betray it with them on your doorstep. All that speaks to a people not savvy in the ways of politics, especially when you presume to educate the builders of the road on it's value as a tollway."

"And yet I wonder if that lack of savvy is an act, for here you are offering to pay the Tsarina with the very coin your tax farmers refused the old Count's nephew and heir. Here you are asking for a Ducal seat, and I wonder if that's not folly at asking the impossible, but rather a gambit to make other demands seem more reasonable. And here I am, entertaining it all with a the straightest of faces."

Did Berko know about this -- the tax farmers, and their failure to pay up the chain -- already? Is this where his big payment is to come from? Or is this the first he has received news of this, and will he now do something about it (for instance, finding the farmers and taking back their ill-gotten gains). 

Either way, Vova continues:

"Count we can make you easily enough, but I can't promise a Ducal seat, that is not within the Tsarina's power. It must be a Ducal Council vote, and you won't be eligible until you're Mezovian again. We can promise to advance you, but we can't promise on results, especially given the path we've taken to get here. We will need to get a Vogovon representative at the table if this is to be a lasting peace, and that will take time because they are a fractious lot. However, I believe I can guess most of their position."

"The Cossacks will want their new pathway to Athamberingia preserved, much as the Tsarina wants her highway preserved. To accomplish both will probably require cleaving the Yutchlands in twain north to south, with the western half rejoining Mezovy. Since the lowlands are easy to sweep through on horseback, both sides will be obligated to fortify. Since the Cossacks are likely to be hot with anger at this reversal, you may find cause to argue for the title of Margrave yet. That is, of course, assuming that you and Berko return with most of your people to the grace of the Tsarina's court. Some of those you have welcomed into your borders have been unwelcome elsewhere in the kingdom, and might find their best prospects lie in the land of half-men to the east. I wonder if Berko's fear of the Queen will lead him to a similar decision."

"I for one hope not. I do hope to meet the man some day, if this can be concluded without one or both of us being gutted in some sordid field battle."

"So what do you think, my stony-faced acquaintance? Would all this let me meet the man, or have I stuck my neck all the way out here for nothing? I can assure you I have very little else I could offer, even as influential as I am. This entire thing has the delicacy and danger of a spun-sugar treat made of gunpowder, and so must be delivered to Her Eminence with the utmost of caution. I have given you the terms I think likeliest to avoid a very sticky explosion, please tell me if they might work."
