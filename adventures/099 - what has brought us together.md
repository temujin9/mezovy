# Plans
- Go hard
  - The NPC backups have staffs etc to get the PCs back up
  - No fear of the birds if they aren't knocked all the way down
  - Downed/dead PCs roll luck every round: 18-20 an NPC revives them, 15- a bird lands on them
- The NPC spellcasters take the worst attacks (save or suck, save or die) first
  - Mostly just do this as flavor, rather than rolling it out

- Threat: 0 if well-concealed, 1 if not engaging, 2 if engaging circle, 3 if engaging lead
- Prot Arrows is DR/magic
  - Mooks hit (10-AC/3) * Threat times
  - Hits shave 3 * hits hp off each round
  - DC (11+2/hit) Fort save vs poison after Prot is broken
  - If someone is downed someone else is likely going to coup-de-grace
- Only did moves for Prince, three lowest in his coven, and Strega 11th (???)
  - Prepare attacks for the rest this round
  - Pull a lot of fun stuff from Full Spell List
  - Many physical attacks, some combat maneuvers
  - Also prepare next rounds attack plans, and then modulate based on who's still up

- Some drow have magic bows and held actions against spellcasters
  +1 composite longbow +12/+7 (1d8+3/Ã—3 + d6 fire)

- Give PCs an edge for the clever shit they're doing to disrupt the ritual
  - Disruption on each side is a 5 clock, each NPC round is a tick, removing a sacrifice is 3 ticks
  - Dylan
    - Magnificent Mansion under the sacrifice to take them off-plane: it's Large but in a tight space, Spellcraft check to drop
      Could also be used against a caster, which would basically short-circuit that battle if they fail a Reflex save
    - Polymorph Any Object for Transmute Rock to Mud plus a decent Knowledge: Geography -> add Geyser to the effect

      https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/geyser/
  - Gallows
    - Dismissal on the sacrificial princess will send her somewhere randomly on the Material Plane

- End with "you've ruined the Queen's plans, she's gunning for you soon, do you wait and prepare or take the fight to her?"
  - Let them have a reasonable amount of time but if they push it she comes
  - Don't determine the threshold ahead of time, just play it by ear
