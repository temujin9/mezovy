- News: Magister from capital writes to Gahdri
  Prior flower pieces were finally remembered, but thirteen years apart. Everyone assumed the nurserymen had some sort of bumper year ritual, and it took asking and their denial, and then hitting some old ex-courtiers with Modify Memory to get the details. Apparently, these have been going on for at least a century, although the prior one was more strongly worded than prior ones, and this one obviously yet more so.
- Rumor: King Cold has retreated north with the deepest frost, but the lands he overran were ravaged almost worse than the Dearth.
