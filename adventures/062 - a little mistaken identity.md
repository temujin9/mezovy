Raag got mistaken for the halfling in charge of the thieves guild in Hinnton, in part because he thinks he is
Aftermath of a "now yous guys can't leave" scene with the koboldlings
Who are the bikers?
- Obvious answer: another group of cossacks
- Inobvious: some other group from the interstices
  - Demihumans: wild elves, gnomes, dwarves, yet more halflings?
  - Fae/extraplanar: aarakocra, centaur, genesai, firbolg
- Riding horses, or ???
- Why were they not just killed? Have to be majority demihuman or human, right?
- Multicultural team with a bunch of Teamwork feats?
  - Make them real shitbags, though
- Bike equivalents?
  - Horses are more like cars: everyone has them
  - Fast move through more difficult terrain is ???
  - Dire bat or giant riding gecko
