## Plans
- Hide in Puryev until the Teleport scroll is ready to go (3 days)
- Pay off the thieves guild, others with some part of the treasury to buy scroll, security detail
  - Lots of subdual damage, sneak-thievery, and intentional complications
  - Frame a PC for robbery by planting goods on them
  - "A game of unconsciousness tag" -- Lurko, probably
- The local lord (now reduced to Burgermeister) is unsympathetic to PCs plight, and forbids all violence on pain of expulsion
  - He doesn't want to be exposed as the pawn of the thieves guild that he is, so he could be leveraged back that way
  - The Sheriff actively opposes the guild, but is aware of the largely futile nature of that
- Seryy's brother is not here, but instead out subduing the countryside, and not expected to return for days

## Booty
1/4 of the Build Points in the back room (??? % of total) in cash form
1/4 of the books from the library, some of the best bits


# GM Goals
- NPCs get the drop on the PCs, proving the value of preparation and coordination
- Witch gets away with the library, forcing PCs to try tracking down the sale at the capital
- PCs can recover most of the BP from the thieves guild, but will cause friction with them
  - Alternatively, they can make good with the guild, gaining an ally who wants to undermine their rival


# Encounters
## Gathering Information
- 1 in 3 rumors are 
  - true, but hard to be sure of (DC 15 Sense Motive or be unsure of the info)

## The Drover Ambush
PCs go near the market area for some reason (gathering info, shopping, etc). Some of the pickpocket kids stage a fight with a bribed accomplice: a "shopkeeper" thrashing one of them for theft. While the PCs are distracted, the remaining kids attempt to pickpocket them, then sprint in various directions. Two more kids Dirty Trick Gallows, wrapping her up in her burka, after which remaining pickpockets go for component pouch, etc. Moments later the drovers have a cattle-drive collision, separating PCs if possible. Then the attack begins in earnest.

The cleric casts Murderous Command, hopefully catching Kat's tiger near Gallows. The Whip Master with Prot. Good on & Shield of Faith on him, lands in the middle of the largest group from roof; he starts AoO Disarm, with kids retrieving the lost items. The drovers converge on the group or on outliers, with similar tactics. The Sap Master keeps to the roofs until someone has left a clear opening, before an acrobatic entry, clubbing, and quick exit.

If the PCs get beaten, they wake up in the gutter stripped of all current valuables.
