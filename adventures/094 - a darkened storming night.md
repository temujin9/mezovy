PCs assault the Crow Prince's castle in Shadow Rovenk, where he has just fled following the Tsarina's interruption of his wedding to the Traitor.

# Results
- PCs plan to hold the castle once taken
- NPC canaries to help locate in Woods https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/rite-publishing-3rd-party-spells/d/divine-beacon/
- Gahdri, Alaric, Anatoli, Nikita, Koshka draw aggro from hobgoblins
- Gahdri++, Yedder, Alaric, Wahnia++, Anatoli, Kostia++, Niobe, Nikita++, Thunder++, Koshka++ draw aggro from gate
- Yedder++, Gahdri++, Ragnar++, Anatoli++, Kostia++, Niobe++, Alaric, Wahnia++, Nikita++, Thunder++, Koshka++

- Ragnar and Nikita and Thunder have spores
- Mind Fog hit Alaric and Kostia

# Plans
- Seryy is doing what he can to show willing to the hobgoblins
  - He can't enact the surrender publicly yet, as doing so will inevitably turn the Ducal council firmly against him
  - He's started evacuating civilians from the eastern lands, pulling eastern forces back to do so

- Ragnar was doing shady shit in Prolichica while the hags attacked Velerolobo
  - Figures out belatedly that Mila was in charge
  - Now he knows Mila and Martus are missing

- TTPCs make it to the city and into castle gates ahead of the wedding party
  - They know their target is the guest wing of the Prince's palace, which is relatively easily accessible and less defended than some parts
  - Round 1: city, lots of lower level drow and hobgoblin guards (2x attacks but CR -2?)
  - Round 2: inside outer bailey, traps, higher level guards and witches
  - Round 3: assaulting keep, traps, more guards with bound demons
  - Real question here is: how much do the PCs leave in the tank and how much do they wait for NPC healing?

# Mass Combat
- PC success determines success
- PC action affects how much focus they get
  - Very visible / front-line: 3d2-3 attackers
  - Normally visible / back-line: 2d2-2 attackers
  - Sneaky / hiding: d2-1 attackers
- Most impressive action last turn gets attention from the leader
- Three rounds and out
  - A combat that is not clearly decided in three rounds is overkill
  - NPC action can account for a lot of ebb and flow
