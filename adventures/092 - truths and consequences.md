# Plans
The PCs convince Seryy to surrender the east to the hobgoblins in exchange for help against the Queen

Opening scene:
- PCs arrive and sit in on the latest war council
  - The Tsarina rallied (got to 10 on her villain clock) & her Holy Warrior Priestess of Law is out in full force
  - Forestalled the Ducal Council acting against Seryy by sidelining the Dukes Amjarsuaq and Khujunfu
  - Akichi pulled Athamberingia into the war on the Tsarina's side, and she'll make hay of that by having them blockade the Yutch
  - Remaining focus is initially pointed at the western front hobgoblins?
  - It's not going to be enough on its own, but it will give the PCs a chance at true diplomacy (or a late "side with Tsarina" move)
- Allow PCs to convince them into a full assault against the Exilarchy itself
  - Ask them to give evidence before their Empress and her war council
  - Don't let them derail the decision process, unless they refuse evidence at all

Private time with Seryy:
- He's largely convinced that joining the hobgoblins against the witchlords is the only way
- He doesn't want to surrender large parts of Mezovy

The PCs finally meet with Ukpik face to face
- He'll definitely Truesight all of them
- He'll want everything east of Bebia and Horenets, and will ask for them too (but let PCs argue him back)
