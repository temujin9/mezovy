"Oh no its the consequences of my actions" montage
- Narrative mode, talk through what you're doing, only roll if I ask you to
- DC X/Y: X means know this outright, Y means get a tease enough to go for a library and spend time finding it out

# 12:00pm
Open with a "devastated battlefield" description, complete with crows wheeling in the sky and feasting upon the dead.

Their new friends are racist assholes
- First level dickbags want to fight the elves all the time
  This is Gahdri & Robert, two of Dylan's are half-elf, what about Gahdri's cohort
- Constant provocation to duel, get wounded or killed and start a blood-feud (even if resurrected)
  Sense Motive to recognize the intent as self-aggrandizing ("MY nemesis is Gahdri.")
- Need to protect NPC elves? Is the Queen framing them to provoke problems?
  Use this if PCs don't rise to the bait
- Surface dwellers angry at how poorly underground dwarves defended them
  Humans grumbling to the PCs, other races grumbling to themselves
- Knowledge(History) DC 20/15 or Gather Info DC 25: dwarves blame elves for the hobgoblin wars (and this war), but nobody's clear on why

# 12:45pm
PCs have armies coming soon
- "Only a handful of days"
  Traveling via roads to Vseia tower and then from Uhlinberg tower
  Let PCs sweat their arrival
  Not in any threat because they're coming alongside the Tsarina's larger force
- They bring word of the testing of the defenses
  
The PCs off-screen defenses are tested but hold
- Material plane gates are all locked, except for Painted Glen
- Faceplant gates are all locked, except for 4th Tower entrance
- L3 gates are somewhat locked, patrols its connection to the material
  Hobgoblin scouts infiltrated via another undiscovered portal, were driven off but make off with intel (humans building forts in the trods)
- Periodic unlocking to get back patrols
  Two bugbear assassins tried to infiltrate via this path to get the key, but get killed at cost of two human lives
- Only one key puts a strain on the resources, shipping it around
  Incentive to up the ante (and thus get the Queen's full attention)

The Tzarina unleashes the full might of her battle-station
- Her troops (Imperial College) are suddenly everywhere
  Sense Motive: all of the towers are cooperating on pain of "being the reason that nine towers bullshit is true again"
  Makes the fight against the giants and hags go faster, but bloodier
- PCs report their current status to the Lord Commander
- They are ordered to raise three more battalions for the other legions' fronts: southwest (2nd), northeast (3rd, giants), and south (4th, Yutch)
  A battalion is 100 men, which is putting Velerolobo at it's 1% limit (or past it if we count the battalion returned)

# 1:30pm
The Queen strikes back
- Her ravens and her son's crows are out in force, meaning less resurrections for everyone
- Mundane crows and ravens will naturally show up in a gory battle, it will take a sharp eye to pick out the cacodaemon among the rest
- She's also got drow and changeling witches whipping up mundane ones as cover, in crow form themselves
  https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape/ II (level 4, 7th level caster)
- They have druid-made rings which give Natural Spell and allow Summon Swarm to be cast at level 3 to bring crows

  Will need a gp value, because PCs are going to steal the shit out of this (Gahdri specifically)
- Lots of higher level dead stay dead instead of getting back up like they normally do
- Dwarves complain about wasting their diamond war reserves

"Fungahol" that dwarves drink

Gandri researches Seal Portal spell
- Leaves copy of this in Rolobo's trod cabin, builds secret workshop

# 2:15pm
Hobgoblins are alerted to their presence and are now hunting for their trods
- For this to work they or their Hag handlers must have items of seek portal
  Which means the PCs will soon have items of seek portal
- Drow/changeling/hag/bugbear/hobgoblin/etc assassins on the PC's trail
  - If they're hobgoblins then we can give players a reason to start looking into how they're related
  - If they're drow then we can give players a reason to start looking into how they're related
    Linguistics DC 40/30: the hill dwarven term for a drow is "four eyes" (for the way the heterochromia looks like a second iris)
    Knowledge(Local) DC 35/25: central heterochromia is the change that happens in drow
  - Ask each PC to tell me how they got caught alone in a bad spot, and then how they got out of it
- Reveal the full relationship between hags and hobgoblins
  Linguistics DC 35/25: The "house" in the hobgoblin name refers to the hag's "hearth" (cauldron, whether or not it's in a house)
  Knowledge(Local) DC 30/20: hobgoblins don't appear to breed, and some speculate that they and bugbears are goblins transformed somehow
- Tease the relationship between elves, drow, and hags?
  Make these depend on earlier info
  Knowledge(Nature) DC 35/25: central heterochromia parallels changeling's complete heterochromia, implies drow -> hag
  The elf -> drow/changeling -> hag step mirrors the baby goblin -> goblin -> hobgoblin steps

- PC responses
  - Dylan snaps wand of summoning, pissing off allies
  - Kat fights uncle for supremacy of tiger clan, closes tiger portal
  - PCs find all but the last info, get tease on the last one
  - Military party to accompany the recruitment effort

# 3:00pm
Minor notes from the rest of the world
- The Blue is making enquiries about royal flowers to the local magisters in Auseq, Polyn, Daydah, and Topolh guilds
  - This raises attention from one of Dylan's spies, and more can confirm if asked: magisters are asking around, and getting positive answers
- Queen just sent flowers to Raag's new contingent (already had sent to Dylan w/o response)
  - Raag reports that he's reached out to his whisper network, and he's getting rumors of flowers in other thieves guilds
  - He senses someone else's whisper network is also asking, but he has no proof and he can't figure out who
- News from Dylan's spies
  - Princess Agnessa of Ossavin's court is lately full of foreign elven dignitaries (Traitor)
  - A pattern of fully loaded ships leaving Prolichica headed east who pick up a full load at the next port without unloading (The Black)
  - Some commotion in Seryy's household, medical in nature and deeply hushed up (Traitor)
  - Details of the intended troop movements from high level spy in Tsarina's court, 
- News from the military advisors
  - Ukpik pulls out of the west and piles it on in the east
  - Gurhandun largely overrun, Khalan, Horenets, Bebia, and Bereria threatened

When the PCs return they receive trickling word with the wounded of second battalion, fighting with 1st legion to retake the southeast
- Tsarina smashed through hobgoblin rear-guard in the west, freeing the Chaos wizards and The Crusader
- Equivalent of the DS9 minefield episode, which means that DS9 is revealed somewhere in here
- DS9: a lizard-man fort in Piekki that sits atop a fae ring, leading to the L1 trod that was the path from Hobgoblin's main L3
  Minefield implies some arcane defenses inside the L1, wrapping the gate in hard-to-escape violence
  Unlike the minefield episode they have other ways around, aren't stuck with armies split

Reveal the Queen somehow
- Make this difficult but tantalizing, so PCs feel they've earned it
- Most likely to chase is Gallows, give him a string of clues
  - Revealed the extent of the flowers more fully (elves involved)
  - Revealed the drow connection?
- Can be a combination of reports that tips the balance into "notable"

# 3:45pm
PCs make plans
- Jerry sends records of findings (drow/hobgoblin/changeling/hag speculative connections)
- Took copy to Royal Wizard Guild a copy of Seal Portal, arrested for 24 hours while it was distributing
  - RWG is sending the spell out to all of the towers
- PCs want to find the Goblin market?
  - Goblins and others, scouting the trods, preparing to infiltrate hobgoblins


# 4:30pm
