Backstory stuff
- The Royal Wizards are going public with general trods information
  - They've distributed copies of that spell to a number of operatives, who are currently teaching it to known sympathizers in the Guilds
  - They plan to announce at the end of the week, once a critical mass of copies are available
  - PCs are informed of the DS9 location and the closing of that path into the hobgoblin L3
- Oskari Leskinen, the gnome trader from Hot Trod, enters PC trods at a hot run after a scheduled opening, under hobgoblin fire
  - Donkey is armored and so is he (its all glamoured) and he carried his good stuff in saddlebags of holding, etc.
  - Lost the wagon but "that's just the bulky cheap stuff, the biggest loss is the wagon itself"
- Mayhem is missing
  - Left a note for Dylan and Robert about how he's bored not doing infiltration and going to fix that
  - "Here's a few Disguise kits, good luck y'all!"
  - Is this the lead-in to Mayhem False and True? Probably.

The Gang Goes Goblin Shopping
- Potential lead: an agent of the Black gets in contact, knows where to go
  - "I'm smart enough to know how dangerous admitting I know this is, so I want enough money to disappear."
  - Brings them to a distant goblin tribe he knows, observes their negotiations if possible
  - The goblin tribe is going to want similarly exorbitant expenses to escort them in, and safe passage to join the tribe the PCs relocated
  - You have to be Small to fit through a goblin door (Tiny), but they already have a tool for that ...
    - Hobgoblins may need to fit through goblin doors, but command-word Reduce Person is pretty cheap (1800gp) for a minute-long dismissible spell

PC Plans
- Discussion on reading in Friar Columbo
  - Everyone steps back from the line to get Dylan to do it
  - They tell him everything post the meeting with the Friar
- Raag sends a message with Seal Portal included to Seryy
  - Sent directly via high level rogue, in a Secret Page
- Investigate the goblin market from the gnomes
  - Get Oskari's help navigating Peikki
  - Vieno Wirtanen is the equivalent of Quark, offers to take them to goblins with a door
  - Most of the above obtained here, save the "safe passage" and "tiny-making tool"
  - Raag does Disguise: Raag 29 (goblin), Dylan 30 (drow), Gahdri 28 (drow), Yedder 26 (drow)
