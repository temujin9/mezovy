# Background events
- [Queen](mezovy/npcs/unseelie/queen of air and darkness.md) sends flowers to Anatoli - take up traditions, or else
- **Berko**: "Did we hear back from the spies we sent to Yutch? Is the matter pressing enough to need our immediate attention?"
  - Spies report that the Count Yutesh's forces are on the march, and will be encamped at the foot of the mountains soon.
  - The Yutch themselves are fairly insular, and spies got the feeling they were only seeing a small part of their world.
- [Caine](mezovy/pcs/villains/Caine of the Black Heart.md): Nicholai, a messenger from a "concerned noble who wishes to remain anonymous" asking that the PCs investigate rumors of ghoulish infiltration of The Church. He offers about 4BP worth of (easy to sell) jewelry and whatever they find, if they can uncover significant information and maybe strike a blow to the enemy.
  - PCs accept the bribe
- [Queen](mezovy/npcs/unseelie/queen of air and darkness.md): perm. Curse Terrain cast on resisters

  - Cheria was hit with Lost Passage (from Forgotten Prince) on road south for 33 miles, and Curse at the ring of stones
  - Uhlinberg was also hard hit, with Curses at Dawold Castle and Zwergdaheim as well
  - Gather Info 30 to determine that it's areas which have spurned the Queen's request for Old Rites
  - Wizards can dispel some of it, but it's very high level (Coven), and hard to beat
- **Kat**: "Goblins want a cooking spoon . . . no, that won't do, we want a good goblin one . . . go to the market, of course?"
