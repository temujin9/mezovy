# Situation
- No further direct attacks against PCs, but still fucking w/ them
- Random faces from attack will show up to intimidate them
- Rumors and bullshit spreading increases
- The accountant is hiding in an abandoned manse (owners fled the Dearth early, haven't returned)

## Paths to success
- PCs could put leverage on the Burgermeister over his corruption, or bribe Burgermeister and guild by "letting it go"
  - To protect themselves, they'd give up the Treasurer's current location
- PCs could bribe the scroll-maker to make it a cursed scroll 
  - He could send the target anywhere (e.g. back to oubliette)

### PC-specific
- Lurko could talk to religious authorities, who (aside from a disliked god of thieves) will shoot straight w/ him
  - They don't know anything about Treasurer's plans, but they do know about corruption and targeting of PCs
- Goose could arrange a mano-a-mano with a guild rep
  - The guild doesn't want much more trouble than it's bought, and would be glad to just put on a show from here
- Kat could talk to the guard
  - Happy to complain about the corruption (e.g. the recent polearm and warhorse policy)
  - Higher ups aren't corrupt, just following corrupt orders, would be glad to be clean
