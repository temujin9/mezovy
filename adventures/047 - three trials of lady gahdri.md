Gahdri becoming a full guild member of Uhlinberg.

# Preplot
- Dylan wanted to know more about whether one of the Royals is sending the flowers
  - Seems very unlikely: they are an incredibly archaic and obscure form of communication
  - All royals received flowers, only some other nobles
- Kat wants to have the messages interpreted
  - Old ones were courting, which slowly turned pushy
  - Ones to royals are mostly still courting, ones to nobles are already pushy

# Introduction / surrounding action
- Gallows wants a wizard duel with a deserving opponent, give him some
  - Gang of spellcasters ready to duel-bully Gahdri
  - Has support in the testing council, who will stack the deck for them
- Big bonus +10 to Gather Information on next match (DC 30) _during_ a match, when those who care are all there
- Gather Information to find plot cookies
  - Fae are troublesome and feared, especially lately
    - Many are shapeshifters, and can look like goblins or other humanoid races
    - Witches are all suspect of fae collusion, thus the tests against them
    - They suspect fae behind the flower messages, and fear further resurgence of [The Old Rites](religion.md)
  - Several of their younger wizards are lost after investigating the recent ghosts
  - Sense Motive at higher DC, +2 with K. Arcana (maybe by Aid Another): no Portal-related magic or know-how
- Betting going on for each of the fights, total result
  - Military Academy and Royal Wizards openly deploring the dueling, and also secretly betting
  - PCs are gonna win the betting, which is strong odds against Gahdri
  - Bookie is a rogue, gonna try to stiff the PCs?
- Will first push for her to be examined for "witch marks" (strip nude, prod familiar, accuse of mushroom eating)
  - Zone of Truth cast by high level examiner (tough save, but actually Profession: Barister check to lie about last one)
- Should beat her in duels, but fail later on a Profession (Barrister) technicality (DC 15, Gahdri can take 10)
  - Treat the testing as hostile (old precedent, not often invoked)
  - Allows counter-challenges against the challenge, though only one per challenge
  - Successful counter-challenge invalidates test in favor of tested
  - Each challenge may only have one counter-challenge, and gang fakes the PCs out on the first?
- Group of goblin fae disguised as halflings do a heist while the duel has attention
  - A well-hidden fae infiltrator is keeping an eye the fights, Sense Motive 35 to catch them out, will dip if noticed

  - Depends on how first duel proceeded
    - Gahdri won: cheating is too subtle to prove, but does alert authorities
    - Gahdri lost: cheating is blatant enough to allow successful counter-challenge
  - Either way, she should probably lose this combat due to the cheating
    - Total Level ~10: 9 plus 6 support

    - Takes time for Detect Magic to pick out the guilty party
    - Takes more time to convince the good ref to pick it out, but they can cast Arcane Sight

    - Royal Guild and their Military Academy warders out some taboo duel-watching with Hart, Uhlinberg friends
    - Local nobles and wizards who don't like them: Izhokia, Cheria, Bebia, Richacren, Gurhandun
