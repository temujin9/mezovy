# Prior Ideas

## Plans
- Push the PCs to split the party
  - Defend the Crow Prince's castle in Shadow Rovenk against the Crow Prince's counter-assault
  - Defend the back-path in The Queen's Woods
  - Assault on The Queen's Garden
- Forces and lords in Darkness weakened by the Mad Mage Oilester
  - He has taken advantage of the chaos in Mezovy, raiding Uhlinberg's remains while the PCs fought the demons
  - Also seen in Hart and collecting demons for his own army
  - How lucid is he about the fronts of this war? Can he identify the demon tower as the queen's work? Is he a potential TTPC ally? Who could tell?

## Mass Combat
- PC success determines success
- PC action affects how much focus they get
  - Very visible / front-line: 3d2-3 attackers
  - Normally visible / back-line: 2d2-2 attackers
  - Sneaky / hiding: d2-1 attackers
- Most impressive action last turn gets attention from the leader
- Three rounds and out
  - A combat that is not clearly decided in three rounds is overkill
  - NPC action can account for a lot of ebb and flow
