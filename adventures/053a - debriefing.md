# The Trial
- Three options:
  1) You acceed to the Hand's charges and accept the loss of 3 hexes territory to Drutk, making the Church advisor Puryev's problem.
  2) You push back in negotiation with the Hand, keeping the 3 hexes but also accepting the Church advisor into your formal meetings and around town in Velerolobo.
  3) You take this to trial in front of the ruler of Drutk, Seryy's brother Žarko. A lot of secret stuff gets discussed under Zone of Truth in front of people you don't like, and the end result is far more uncertain. (This one would take place as a later session, with the in-world explanation that Žarko will need time to study evidence and prepare for this.)
