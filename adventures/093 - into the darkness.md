# Plans
- Ukpik will take an opportune time to trigger the Lord Hob problem for The Queen
  - Waiting until clear action happening elsewhere
  - Wants Mezovy to provide an attack vanguard here too, anyone risk-taking with flying? (Lurko is leading a flying squad ... )

- Darkness is a noir setting (b&w, lots of shady shit)
  - Lots of undead / death magic, much of it not malicious
  - Unlike stock Pathfinder, this plane doesn't have an evil bent
  - Some sneaky sessions, to emphasize Ragnar as a character
  - Play with World of Darkness themes
    - Vengeful werewolves, scheming ghouls, shadow-warping mages, angsty ghosts, colorful fae courts
    - Replace Technocracy/Wyrm/Inquisition with witch-lords, don't focus too much unless the PCs do
  - Play with Ravenloft themes
    - Demesnes take on characteristics of their rulers, who are supernaturally invested and somewhat trapped here
    - Ruler ideas: Abstemious, Grey Eye, Prince of Crows & his coven mates, Assassin, Binder's Apprentice
- Shadow is a metaphorical shadow of Mezovy
  - Smaller copy (half size?) of the same geography
  - Smaller native populations (half? less?) all light afflicted (poor hobgoblin recruits if goblins)
  - In keeping w/ noir, level is more evenly distributed (i.e. 1/5 as many 1st level)
  - Different population balance: drow/wayang/goblin culture in charge, fetchling/urden/duergar minorities at edges
  - Leadership is openly drow (non-native) with hobgoblin and collaborator troops, instead of humanity (but vaguely paroding them)
  - No wizard towers, but powerful witchlord coven holdings
  - Wizards are hated and attacked here like witches are in Mezovy
- PCs will need to scout a path from the Urden to one or more drow manses
  - Wah'nilla will know the basics though not recent history
  - Akichi may advise them on approaches, or connect them with an agent
  - Uncle Ivan could connect them with the In Aghaidh expies

- Results of Tsarina's intervention on marriage
  - The Black will provide enough information to track it down
  - Tsarina will be distrustful of the non-Royal-Wizard source, but act
  - Action will not prevent marriage, but will keep it off Material Plane
  - Ergo it's happening in Prince of Crows' castle (in Shadow Rovenk) tomorrow noon
  - PCs can risk all of their planning here to stop it, or they can let it happen


# Results
- Start in realm of (Changeling Wizard 9th with Coven feats)
- PCs get led to meet the In Aghaidh
- PCs twig to the issue with "The Queen's Garden": Alice In Wonderland
- PCs want to attack The Prince's place while he's out, and send Seryy to Grey Eye's place
- Planning to assault via a portal near the Prince's palace
- PCs inform Samvanzu about Darkness
- PCs learn of The Prince's flight to his castle here in Shadow
