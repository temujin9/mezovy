# Mass Combat
- PC success determines success
- PC action affects how much focus they get
  - Very visible / front-line: 3d2-3 attackers
  - Normally visible / back-line: 2d2-2 attackers
  - Sneaky / hiding: d2-1 attackers
- Most impressive action last turn gets attention from the leader
- Three rounds and out
  - A combat that is not clearly decided in three rounds is overkill
  - NPC action can account for a lot of ebb and flow
