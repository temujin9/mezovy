Level Up
- Keep track of where you are now, for the Kingdom Building
- 4000XP (exactly enough to get to level 7)
- 1500gp purse from Seryy for your good work in the capital

Freeform PC actions
- Let Gallows get a Linguistics and another reward, to establish the precedent

Kingdom building
- Tzarina details two armies, sends 50BP to shore up Velorolobo
  - Each army can retake a hex by moving into it
- PCs are not privy to larger plans, due to the invasive nature of the enemy
- Orders are to retake Velorolobo quickly, raise local armies, and march on Rovenk with Drutk, Ossavin, and Topolh in summer
- Tzarina approves of the road, makes it a priority of both your Counties (if PCs haven't already), wants it south of river

Establishing question: How did your character come to join Seryy's ranks?
