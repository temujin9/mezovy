# Plans
- Hags are happy with this being a suicide run: they are all in Coven with Grey-Eye, and can Reincarnate and rehag the Blood from a preserved knuckle
- Bugbears are less happy with suicidal nature (reincarnate wouldn't keep them bugbears), will fuck off if a local fight goes against them
- Hags used their group SLAs prior to the fight
  - Charm and Dream on villagers to carry the idiot ball
  - Veil the assassin teams
  - Animate Dead to make the attacking squads
  - Control Weather to create a blizzard, takes 10 minutes to manifest
  - Mind Blank on all assassins and hags
- Ash Hag tries to paralyze and burn tigers
  Melee: +14 to hit, d8+23 +paralysis

    This is a call-forward to The Queen's curse upon her own death

- Assassins go after exposed PCs and Cohorts
  - All teams are under Veil (hr/level) from hags, Dylan passed the Will save once attacked, but it looks like villagers to Alaric (no interaction)
- Hags have enchanted some of the townsfolk to do bad things
  - Control Monster: must win Cha test to make them do weird things, no suicidal orders but risky is fine, 9 days so plenty of time
  - Make it innocent things like "we can't close the door to my beloved from ??? farm" at first
    - Weeping farmers and wives to PCs and NPCs on main thoroughfare
  - Escalate to "disabling defense mechanisms" and "put self in dangerous positions to rescue beloved"
    - Lumbermen start attacking the bar for critical doors
    - Farmers with inadequate tools going towards masses of undead
- Cacodaemon crows are hunting souls
  - Full round action once PC or Cohort is down
  - Covered by unkindness of ravens
- When things look hopeless, start teleporting Seryy and Co in
  - Ideally, steal at least one soul first
  - Make "survive a few more rounds" believable
