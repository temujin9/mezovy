## Recent News and Rumors
If PCs make any attempt: "The castle has been closed for about two weeks now, and nobody's dared go close. Several of the men-at-arms were seen swimming to shore from the north tower. Before they fled back east, one of them said he'd seen hell. Then the hobgoblins came and we all saw it."

"Clemval Shadb√¨ncir, a low-level aristocrat, was to marry Unelle Fanavan at Silver Belfry. Was." (DC 12 Diplomacy)
  This went . . . poorly. "To shreds, you say? And his wife? To shreds, you say?" They're currently half-eaten, up in the castle courtyard.
"Carval Yslantas, a renowned trader, was publicly accused of failing to pay taxes" (DC 15 Diplomacy)
  This poor fellow is currently hanging to the wall in the main prison room. Well, half of him is, anyway. The other half is in the well.
"The Blacksmiths Guild has jailed one of its officers for alleged embezzlement" (DC 18 Diplomacy)
  This poor fellow is currently sitting in the other oubliette, awaiting interrogation and sentencing. He knows both he and Carval are innocent, though he doesn't suspect the treasurer who framed them.
"The annual Corn Festival commences this week, or it should have anyway." (DC 21 Diplomacy)
  Nobody feels like getting this done, but failing to do so will be a morale hit.
"Saw some folks sneak into Garter Battlement. Thought they were up to quick hanky-panky, but they never returned." (DC 24 Diplomacy)
  This was the ratfolk, heading into the castle via the tunnels they'd heard about.
"The ancestors of this lord included a powerful ice mage, which is why it's called The Blue Castle." (DC 25 K. Nobility/History or DC 27 Diplomacy)
There's a Permanent Teleport Trap covering the whole castle, leading to the oubliettes on room 8 of the dungeon level. (DC 28 K. History/Arcana)
The defenses are keyed to the lawful ruler of the castle. (DC 30 K. Nobility/Arcana)
  Having a formal crowning on the throne should do it, but that'll take some PC noodling to figure out.
There's also a custom Permanent spell that makes all cold damage strike like cold iron & silver within the castle grounds. (DC 30 K. History/Arcana)
  This plus the Ice Golems make it a pretty strong anti-evil-outsider protection

## Other Points of Interest
Garter Battlement is notorious as a place where lovers go for discreet affairs.
Silver Belfry is a popular site for marriages and betrothals, as the goddess of wealth -- Zlata Baba -- is said to give her blessing to unions made there. It's currently missing one of its peacock gargoyles. PCs who have caught the treasurer in his embezzlement, avenged the hobgoblin's murder in her chapel, or returned the gargoyle may pray to her and receive a boon.

27 - Secret library, very dusty and unused, full of half-rotten books. All books in an ancient and cryptic version of Dragonic (Linguistics DC 35 to read, -10 if you already know Draconic). With time and effort an arcane spellcaster could extract useful knowledge from the books here, but they are experimental logs: the spellbooks themselves sold years before to fund a family expedition. They're also worth a small fortune -- ??? BP -- to the right collector (DC 35 K. Nobility to have heard rumors, DC 25 Appraise/K. Nobility/K. Arcana to recognize their inherent value).

  Scared by the Babau as a distraction, which worked for all the NPCs outside





# At end of Kat's adventure
Treasurer came to work with prior rulers to look for the hidden library, hadn't succeeded, but did find secret treasury. Familiar noticed PCs finding secret room. Will make off with secret treasury contents, hidden lab's books via Portable Hole and Dimension Door once outside of the castle walls.
- Sense Motive
  DC  Result
  20  Something's fishy about things at the castle (capstone, in-class, +2 stat, roll 10)
      If the PCs do something about this, Treasurer makes off with three-quarters of the library, and half the secret treasury
  25  That hidden library is a valuable target (roll 15)
      If the PCs do something about this, Treasurer makes off with only half the library, and a quarter the treasury
  30  If someone was looking for the library, right now after all the chaos would be the best time to take it (roll 20)
      If the PCs do something about this, Treasurer makes off with only a quarter of the library and secret treasury
  35  The Treasurer has been embezzling, probably looking for library (capstone, in-class, +5 stat, +2 feat, roll 20)
      If the PCs do something about this, Treasurer makes off with only a quarter of the library, and none of the secret treasury
