# New plan
- Triune heavy three-part episode
- The PCs chose to free the elder wizards
  - Many have been mind-fucked, Secret Page can be undone but Erase cannot
  - Two remain viable, PCs can help define options:
    - Powerful abjuration mage from her time
    - Hallowed necromancer
    - Conjuration
  - The third, Oilester, will show up to finish the Abyss side if PCs represent there
- Three marriages
  - Prince and Princess
  - Queen and Koschei
  - Material Plane and Abyss - TODO: needs symbolic components
    - Where all the elements meet: volcanic springs atop The Eldest (ice-peaked mountain in central Mezovy)
    - Sacrifices of meaningful people/creatures on both sides: many powerful soul gems in Abyss, powerful qlippoth

- Force the players to split
- The Trio and Grey Eye are standing guard over the ritual in the Abyss
- ??? standing guard over the ritual on the mountain

## General rules
It’s difficult to disrupt a ritual. Casting a ritual does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the casters can pause the ritual to engage in combat or take other actions—though not without consequences. For each round an occult ritual is paused in this way, the DC of all the ritual’s subsequent skill checks increases by 1. For practical purposes, a ritual is successfully disrupted when its casting is paused for more than 1 minute or any of the casters are incapacitated, killed, or moved more than 100 feet from (or out of line of effect of ) all other casters.
