# Plans
- PC goals are to get soul gems (to free their comrades) and scribes binding of wizards
- Get everyone's AC, SR, static Stealth (skill+10), make repeated attacks on all
- Make PCs burn some of their limited resources at each step
  - If they don't, they get less of the available choices
  - This burn is what determines the "choices" if it's not clearly made
  - Engaging in physical combat makes them a target, giving them burn in form of attacks
- Give them a picaresque of taking the battle to the gates of Hell
  - Demons and drow here are in an uneasy standoff
  - Huge demons (Nalfeshnee, Glabrezu, etc) are only patrolling outside
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholomance here, a Tower to counterbalance Mezovy's
  - They're unprepared for an invasion, but lots of protections and traps
- Give them repeated choices "pick two" between
  - Demons: Get some soul gems
  - Drow: Get a couple big books
  - Sneak: Avoid serious harm to self or followers
- Final choice is "pick two" between
  - Library: Get several big books
  - Vault: Get a big ass pile of soul gems
  - Wedding: Capture or kill the Traitor, perhaps harm the Prince
    A Marilith is here, can be heard delivering a snub from Koschei to his "not-a-son-in-law", if stealth is used
  - Sneak: Avoid serious harm to self or followers
- The Prince gets away with his circle once its clear that the day is lost
- The PCs and their armies can follow him to the top of the mountain? No he's gonna Planeshift and Teleport, or maybe even Gate.
