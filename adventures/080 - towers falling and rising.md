Tower of Fear already set up
- Door from the demiplane opened up first
- Drow on other side come through to secure the area
- Drop the instant tower and leave via Shadow Walk
- Other door opens, demons come through

Inside of the tower of fear
- Portal to Material Plane
  - Inside was locked both physically and magically
  - Outside has Nondetection (CL DC 30) and Permanent Invisibility, cast by Prince of Crows
- Demiplane cast at 20th level
- Permanency cast on the plane
- Portal to a part of the Abyss that Kosechei has Welcomed The Gentry into
  - Inside is locked physically and magically
- Top has observation platform
  - Portal to another Demiplane at top (normal magic, Queen's agents can lock door or dispel, leads back to her palace)
  - Permanent high winds blowing from top to grates in bottom, to make flight up difficult

PCs gave ~2 rounds past the alarm signal from their people
- Setup is really just "drop tower and bolt", so it's already done
  - NPCs can describe the action if PCs seek them out
- Appearances
  - 20ft square tower, 30ft high with battlements
  - Small door at base open with dretches marching out
  - Hatethralls and Halas flying out of top
  - Larger demons teleporting outside, getting bearings, teleporting again
  - Through door can be seen a place in space that demons are stepping out of
  - Wind constantly blowing outward, hatethralls are carried on spearheads and hala walking
  - Ravens and crows everywhere, avoiding the demons and landing on the freshly dead
    - How many times could the Prince have duplicated his Cacodaemon for this?
    - Irrelevant, the core familiars both have command-word Duplicate items
- How many demons are there?
  - Just random encounter some, since few have real motive to stick around?
  - Some have a given role in defending tower
  - Various magical countermeasures expected, need Dispel (Babau, Nalfeshnee)
  - Will probably target anyone who locks the door, maybe try to steal the key

What allies show up to help PCs?
- Ice duelist
  - Emphasize their absolute 1:1 devastation, but lack of unity coherence
  - Want to keep them around but fine to injure severely / kill and don't soul-reap
- Royal Mages
  - Emphasize their tactical unity, the known NPCs bringing active backups
- Church
  - Arrive along with Royal Mages, appear to be at Mage's behest
  - Will be casting Forbiddance (Law) which can hurt PCs too, but takes 6 rounds
- Ask the PCs who else they bring

Who should die?
- Innocents, by the cartload, to emphasize that every delay is costly
- At least one or two meaningful ones, in addition to PC risk
- Every allied death should grant them an opportunity, nobody named dies in vain
- Followers, by the handful
- Cohorts - Neobe, Kostia, Thunder, Koshka
- Friendly NPCs - Duelist, Royal mage advisors, Columbo
  - There's two royal mages, we can afford to lose one
  - Threaten the loss of the duelist to motivate
- PCs 
  - Threatening the portal is marking for PVP, and demons go hard
  - Telepathic shout in Abyssal of "The portal! Get that one!" so everyone knows what's what
