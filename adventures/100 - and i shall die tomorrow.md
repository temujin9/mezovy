Final confrontation with the Queen

Prerequistes:
- Seryy survives to this point. (If not, is it Mayhem? Too close to DMPC?)
- The Queen is a known target, and PCs are pursuing her through her redoubt.
- PCs have at least a long rest after achieving 17th level, to get everything ready

Give each PC an opportunity to sacrifice themselves to kill her, if they don't Seryy does. She has used ritual magic to curse her own death, so that it will nigh-inevitably poison her killer. The "break" DC is the same super-high level that the Demiplanes are, the save is the same, and it requires two saves to evade. If you die of it you can't be resurrected, you immediately go to your reward.

If the PCs do nothing:
- Seryy finds and kills the Queen, dying in the attempt

- The drow win by default
  - The artificer is found and murdered
  - The Traitor is named heir
  - The Queen dies, but her son and the witchlords rule Mezovy & Air & Darkness

- The hobgoblins could win 
  - If ...
    - The Queen's murder of the heirs and conspiracy with The Traitor is broadly proven, or
    - The Artificer gets hold of elf-blood trick to hobgoblin recipe, or
    - Goblin or Tokra witches get hold of and use the Codex, or
    - PCs find some other path to their victory
  - Ukpik conquers Mezovy, in a protracted battle that devastates it
    - If Seryy survives as Prince he can surrender early, sparing more of it
  - The witchlords hegemony shatters, turning Air & Darkness into feuding warlord states
