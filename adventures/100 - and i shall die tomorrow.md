# Plans
- Privately get each player's answer to the following
  - How Good has your character been, honestly?
  - Is your character fully prepared to die permanently?

- The final assault is only backstopped by their remaining allies
  - This means little or no NPC help, but also perhaps a protected escape path

- Set the setting
  - Queen's castle is like the farcaster houses from Hyperion: mirrors that open to rooms on other planes
  - Plane of mirrors that can be shifted like the goblin market can by The Queen's touch
  - Mirrors can also be moved physically for D&D movie-like shenanigans
  - Picaresque of the planes where she holds sway
    - Plane of Air: several places (near fire -- desert-like, near water -- sea-storm-like)
    - Shadow Plane: a tower on the Old Man, the castle in Minech
    - The Sea King's castle in a habitable bubble on plane of water
    - Styerrabrae: ruined castle on mostly uninhabited island on Material
    - Mezovian castles (Rosalk, Ossavin, Richacren) and thieves guilds, Vogovan castles, Athamberingian planes: seen in passing only
  - Everything is full of filigree that provides cover up to improved (+8 AC, +4 reflex, +10 stealth, gives evasion)

- Counters for every PCs bullshit, deploy as reasonable
  - Counterfire sneak archers for casters and Robert
  - Flying opponents (Unkindness, Cacodaemons) to screen the tigers from the Queen: Fly skill contest
  - Countercasters vs Gallows, Jerry, Dylan
  - SR 31 for Queen and coven

- Figure out some standard chaff to send their way as well
  - Poison saves from the Poison Garden: luck checks, 20 no saves, 16-19 one save, 11-15 two saves, 10- three saves
    Ritual magic that gives all the plants here Spell Immunity to Delay Poison
    https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/

    - Mooks hit (12-AC/3) times for 3d6hp and a poison save
    - Improved Drow Poison: Fortitude DC 16, 1/minute for 2 minutes, Unconsciousness for 1 minute, Unconsciousness for 2d4 hours
    - Better Mooks hit (12-AC/4) times for 3d6hp and a poison save
  - Melee for any melee engaging Queen directly or making good attacks
  - ??? weaker spells with low save DCs

- Throw the Queen's worst at them
  - Hit and run tactics
    - All opponents hold standard to interfere with PC action, move to retreat
    - Queen acts, then moves through a nearby portal with allies
    - If PCs don't come through the next round she spins the portals, then attacks obliquely
    - Will sacrifice true believers and dominated allies to gain advantage
    - Will get at least some initiative over PCs, due to the spells
  - First encountered / whenever she gets a moment to breathe
    - Moment of Prescience (8th) burn for +25 vs most things

- 7:30pm final death
  - Any attacks which would bring her to negative hp instead bring her to 0hp, and ability damage stops at 1, until ...
    - Of those PCs who are good and prepared, the highest initiative that inflicts serious damage kills her ...
      - Unless there are no good and prepared candidates still up, in which case Seryy sacrifices himself to save the day
  - Close with the poem

    Her strong enchantments failing, Her towers of fear in wreck, Her limbecks dried of poisons, And the knife at her neck,
    The Queen of air and darkness, Begins to shrill and cry, 'O young one, O my slayer, To-morrow you shall die.'
    O Queen of air and darkness, I think 'tis truth you say, And I shall die tomorrow; But you will die to-day.



# Old Notes
Final confrontation with the Queen

Prerequistes:
- Seryy survives to this point. (If not, is it Mayhem? Too close to DMPC?)
- The Queen is a known target, and PCs are pursuing her through her redoubt.
- PCs have at least a long rest after achieving 17th level, to get everything ready

Give each PC an opportunity to sacrifice themselves to kill her, if they don't Seryy does. She has used ritual magic to curse her own death, so that it will nigh-inevitably poison her killer. The "break" DC is the same super-high level that the Demiplanes are, the save is the same, and it requires two saves to evade. If you die of it you can't be resurrected, you immediately go to your reward.


Ways to keep the Queen from coming back:
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hasten-judgment/
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-soul-gem/
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soul-transfer/



If the PCs do nothing:
- Seryy finds and kills the Queen, dying in the attempt

- The drow win by default
  - The artificer is found and murdered
  - The Traitor is named heir
  - The Queen dies, but her son and the witchlords rule Mezovy & Air & Darkness

- The hobgoblins could win 
  - If ...
    - **The Queen's murder of the heirs and conspiracy with The Traitor is broadly proven**, or
    - The Artificer gets hold of elf-blood trick to hobgoblin recipe, or
    - Goblin or Tokra witches get hold of and use the Codex, or
    - PCs find some other path to their victory
  - Ukpik conquers Mezovy, in a protracted battle that devastates it
    - If Seryy survives as Prince he can surrender early, sparing more of it
  - The witchlords hegemony shatters, turning Air & Darkness into feuding warlord states
