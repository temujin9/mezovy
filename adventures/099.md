# Plans
- Give PCs an edge for the clever shit they're doing to disrupt the ritual
  - Disruption is a 10 clock, removing each sacrifice is 4 ticks, each NPC round is a tick

- Only did moves for Prince, three lowest in his coven, and Strega 11th
  - Prepare attacks for the rest this round - pull a lot of fun stuff from Full Spell List
  - Prepare next rounds attack plans, and then modulate based on who's still up
- Need to figure out AC/CMD/saves/HP for most enemies
- Prot Arrows is DR/magic, drow here all have magic bows
  - Shave X off each round, just in case it can wear off completely

- Dylan
  - Magnificent Mansion under the sacrifice to take them off-plane: it's Large but in a tight space, Spellcraft check to drop
    Could also be used against a caster, which would basically short-circuit that battle if they fail a Reflex save
  - Polymorph Any Object for Transmute Rock to Mud plus a decent Knowledge: Geography -> add Geyser to the effect

- Gallows
  - Dismissal on the sacrificial princess will send her somewhere randomly on the Material Plane

- End with "you've ruined the Queen's plans, she's gunning for you soon, wait and prepare or take the fight to her?"
  - Let them have a reasonable amount of time but if they push it she comes
  - Don't determine the threshold ahead of time, just play it by ear
