# PC actions
- PCs introduced to Jerry's Wayang Cohort
- PCs split the party
  - Ragnar and Koshka stay to watch disguised as wizard (Bluff of 37 & 30)
  - Rest go portal hunting, lock the L2s several deep
- Kat investigates the captain coming to the back of the shop
- Handlers use Plane Shift to kidnap Akichi
- PCs show up right after and use Gate to follow when they get message
- Akichi and PCs quickly set up fake attack on Akichi to cover





# Planning
- What happens if the PCs do nothing
  - Akichi continues to pursue his plot, achieving partial success
  - Akichi's handlers eventually conclude that he's betrayed them
  - Akichi is kidnapped before he can communicate
    - Plane Shift to a small trod with an elf-door exit into Patron's lands in the Dark Woods, locking behind
    - Akichi can only give a round or two of warning to PCs before the card will be found
    - Their patron interrogates him for a while but learns nothing of consequence
  - Kidnappers take Akichi to The Queen and he's sent to the Prince of Crows
  - The Prince writes Akichi into a book, and undoes his success
  - The Prince confirms the existence of the goblin rebellion, several other things

- Likely responses
  - PCs can Plane Shift and then Teleport to intercept, or burn that Gate scroll to get there directly
  - Handlers will teleport away to edge of the Teleport Traps as a response, then flee through the poison garden
  - PCs can intercept the handlers before they reach attention of the guards
  - Taizai can get himself out of this and remain double-agent, *if* he can turn on the PCs, making them targets

- Who are the Queen's handlers
  - Two higher-level witches with their familiars, and a ??? hag
  - Work for ??? high in witchlord heirarchy
  - Can summon a kill squad? Tarnek, other anti-team?

- Queen's handlers' motivations
  - Akichi is an untrusted but necessary agent, seeking info about
    - Hlyboko's L3 trod operations
    - Who publicized her plans (the PCs)
  - If he's a double-agent, whatever Akichi is after is a vulnerability in Queen's operation to be found
  - The recent appearance of weird high level dignitaries from another realm (the PCs)

- The thing that Akichi is working on, and what it gets the PCs if they win
  - Deceive Athamberingia into joining open war on Mezovian side? (In The Pale Moonlight)
  - Athamberingian envoy given faked https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/clockwork/clockwork-spy/
  - Envoy is killed coming back from the border
  - If Akichi is broken, the deception can be undone

- The hidden things that Akichi knows about Hlyboko and the goblin resistance if they lose
  - Goblin resistance exists and was canny enough to recruit him quicker
  - (maybe) Goblins know how to make more hobgoblins
  - (maybe) Goblins know how to make demiplanes
  - (maybe) PCs are the ones responsible for leaking The Queen's plot, maybe several other things
