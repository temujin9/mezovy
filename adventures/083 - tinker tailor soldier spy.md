# PC actions
- Tell RWI they're locking trods
- Koshka sees a cat watching
- Nikita and Anatoli order a dress from Akichi which will take 2-3 days
  - He notices her looking for the cat
- Koshka finds the cat has disappeared
  - Probably teleported to its owner after it got clocked by Akichi
- Ragnar catches view of a gecko, does fire performance to keep eye on it
- Gahdri and Yedder flirt with Akichi 
- They meet in an illusion room, Gahdri nondetections, Akichi covers the puppet's head with a blackout bag
- Akichi tells them he's working on a thing and needs a few days





# Planning
- Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
  - Tinker is Krekhan
  - Tailor is Akichi Taizai (Elim Garrak expy)
  - Soldier is Ukpik
  - Spy: someone offscreen ("Beggerman" played by Gary Oldman) is going to try to get to Tailor
  - Implies Garrak is a double agent for Queen and Rebellion, being flushed out by The Queen's counterintelligence


 
- Taizai is working some angle he doesn't want to be pulled away from
  - It's almost certainly a trap but the payoff would be too good
  - PCs have to protect him, minimize damage when his cover blows
  - Ideally they do this without getting clocked themselves

- TBD: What information might the The Queen's agents be seeking at Hlyboko?
  - Where the Mezovians who know her plans are
  - Which trod the Royal Wizards are using and how it's secured
  - Get to and turn Taizai into a double-agent

- TBD: What is Taizai after?
  - Deceive Athamberingia into joining open war on Mezovian side? (In The Pale Moonlight)
  - Rescue lizardman (father) from a failed attack on The Queen (In Purgatory's Shadow)
