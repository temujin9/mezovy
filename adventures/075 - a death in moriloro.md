TACTICS

Before Combat He casts magic vestment every day. Before combat, if he hears the sounds of battle elsewhere in the house, he casts resist energy (fire), bull’s strength, and shield of faith, and activates his ring of force shield (included in stats).
During Combat He casts divine power on the first round of combat. In battle, he attempts to soften foes up with channel energy and separate them with a blade barrier hidden within obscuring mist. He attempts to pick off foes one at a time from the mist with slay living and harm, using his area affect spells for opponents that remain grouped together.
