Pre-council
- Rumors: group discussion upcovers these, no source no attribution, everyone rolls Gather Info once (or can Aid Another)
  Add some more, to give it verisimilitude
  * DC 0: for Kat, "The Hunters of Rovenk left Osmyzk and headed south about 2 weeks ago."
  DC 5: The Tzarina is with child, yet again? (unclear if true)
  DC 10: Tzarina was trying to set Grand Duke Marko and Nikkita up to "see what the litter would look like"
  DC 15: Uncle Ivan got an invite (and interview) from Zarko
  * DC 20: Khalan is seeing hobgoblin growth to west
  * DC 25: Utrik Goblinbane of Bebia is looking to recover his homeland (connect with Zvezdana?)
  * DC 30: Uhlinberg has ice giant problems, and maybe more?
  DC 35: Uhlinberg, Richacren, or Hart is hag infiltrated
  DC 40: Doberken is hag infiltrated

Tzarina's War Council
- Ninoslava is dead, Tzarina and Seryy are both inconsolable and livid
  - Also soul-stolen: reports are that a raven materialized on it, breathed in her dying breath
  - Princess Kira Matrona Kuznetsov (age 12) acquitted herself at the spring ball and is raised to her place in Vseia
  - Vasilisa has it bound up tight w/ ritual, plans to use it as collateral at a vital point
- Interpreter for language of flowers
  - Large group of courtiers, *terrified* to be actually useful to the Tzarina for once
  - Push forward trio who pushes forward one, who provides translation with hemming and hawing
  - "Not invited, what an awkward situation? No idea 'bout the bird, begging pardon. Blue jays ain't in the book."
- K: Planes
  - DC 22 to recognize the cacodaemon ability
  - DC 27 to realize it's a familiar to a high level caster
  - DC 29 to recognize a fae-touched cacodaemon, -5 if also have K: Nature, +5 to connect man-in-the-back
  - Spellcraft
    - DC 19 to remember Duplicate Familiar is a spell (if they figure out familiar)
    - DC 30 to recognize how high level she must be to do what she did casually
- Why the blue bird?
  - DC 15 Bardic/Nature, DC 20 History/Nobility: "Rolobo and the Lady Fair"
    - Tawdry romance about how Rolobo the Blue rescued "The Lady Fair" from Kostchtchie
    - Heroic magics, implied fucking, then she disappears from his life
    - Last words of the poem refer to "his blue bird of happiness pursued her, and he passed soon after it"
  - DC 20 Bardic/Religion, DC 25 History: "Vasilisa and Kostchtchie"
    - Similar to Rolobo, but instead it's "Princeling Kuznets"
    - Morality play about trusting dark powers and those captured by them
    - Ending is ambiguous whether the prince gets eaten by Kostchtchie (spoiler alert: yes)
  - DC 25 Bardic/History, DC 30 Nobility: "The Ancestry of Kuznetsov Clan"
    - DC -5 if someone explicitly mentions searching the rolls
    - Tzar Kuznets reputedly founded the clan about 1200 years ago, was originally a blacksmith
    - Scholarly estimates put it at more like 920 years ago: some retroactive exaggeration of timelines
    - Rolobo Kuznetsov was second child of the Tzar Kuznets, and died childless
    - Responsible for existing protections on Velorolobo and the capital
    - Rolobo Kuznetsov's talking thrush is mentioned, though not by color
    - Stories of his demise are confusing, but appears to have died suddenly
  - Spellcraft tells Gallows about rituals
- Library of Rolobo may have further clues (spoiler: yes)

Prep for kingdom building
- Tzarina details two armies, sends 50BP to shore up Velorolobo
- PCs are not privy to larger plans, due to the invasive nature of the enemy
- Orders are to retake Velorolobo quickly, raise local armies, and march on Rovenk with Drutk, Ossavin, and Topolh in summer
- Tzarina approves of the road, makes it a priority of both your Counties (if PCs haven't already), wants it south of river
