The PCs take a trip to Prolichia.

Results:
- Beat up the dwarf highwaymen
- Kat visits guards
- Raag, Ragnar, and Anatoli visit with Martsell & co
- PCs except Gahdri visit with the Patritsiy
- Ragnar, Gahdri, Nikita fight kayfabe (+2BP)


Prolichia layout:
- Homage to Ankh-Morpork where we can, politely
- Ruled by the Patritsiy (based on Moist von Lipwig, a well-leveled Vigilante)
- Home to many forms of industry unfamiliar to those from the sticks
- Most visible spot is not the Patritsiy's Palace, but Tadun Castle (Tower of Art)
  - Tadun Castle: This large walled castle sits upon the banks of a river, spanned by a drawbridge. It is inhabited by a civilized ghoul named Mira Tadun.

  - Military / the guard
    - Kat: Vamys the guard captain, elite cossacks
    - Lots of nudge-nudge-wink-wink distaste for the gladiators (Sense Motive 20, all show, they love 'em)
    - Heightened directionless awareness, has bred strife with local underworld
    - Patritsiy is juggling a delicate balancing act inherited from his predecessor (about whom dark rumors circulated)
    - The Alchemist's Guild have been trying to talk them into massed guns, nobody's buying it
    - Cossack elite guardsmen have friends who couldn't quite hack it in the Prolichia guard, they could grow your troop
  - Church
    - Looking for evidence of ghoulishness, what can they find (Diplomacy 30, -5 if K: Religion 5 ranks)

  - Trods/Goblin Market
    - Diplomacy 20: Find rumors that "the kobolds know how to reach the goblin market"
    - "We must not look at goblin men,
      We must not buy their fruits:
      Who knows upon what soil they fed
      Their hungry thirsty roots?"
    - Find the kobolds' sunken gate (accidentally?), figure out that they're under the church
