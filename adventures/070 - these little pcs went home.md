Wee Wee Wee All The Way Home

Plans:
- Make it easy to get in, and then make them fight to escape
- Goblin artificer finds them, delivers a Hannibal Lecture? May lead to negotiation w/ Ukpik.
  - How? Goblin leadership has better ground intelligence than the elves, and know the PCs are there
    - Also https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-scrying/ would have seen Kat? Maybe not, given indirection, but easy guess?
  - Why? Because he wants to scout the PCs? (Does he have Detect Good? It'd be funny ... )
  - Is this Ter Khrekaan or a minion?
  - The Queen intends to make a permanent Tower of Fear. Drop that, don't elaborate, and force them out the door before they can ask more
  - :alarms: "It appears Lord Hob has discovered your presence. When he finds you he will not find me. Good day." :batman vanish:
- The door home is closed / scrambled, now what
  - Either The Queen has delegated this to Lord Hob, or she does it herself
  - Delegation seems more her style, which means Lord Hob's got control of the Labyrinth's ability to twist
  - PCs don't seem set on relying on this, instead going for a known larger door that goes to trods
- Crows and ravens wheeling in the distance
  - Chase the PCs with ballistic hobgoblins, djinni, ???
  - Is it witchlords or The Queen herself?
- Hobgoblins and hags and maybe drow hunting the PCs
  - They're gonna lock the first door behind them and chuckle; immediately hit them with more trouble from another door
- How involved is The Queen in jailbreak response? ~None~
  - Very: she knows who the PCs are now, and unleashes direct powers
  - Some: she doesn't know who the PCs are yet, and unleashes powers at distance
  - None: she finds out about it later, perhaps to the displeasure of minions
