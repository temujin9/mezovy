# Plans
- Missed from last time: Kat gets monkeyed with by fire monkeys

- How does Ragnar show up, and what does he know?
  - Dim door in with a 

- Hags
  - Happy with this being a suicide run if they can cap a couple of the heroic defenders
  - Mind Blank on all hags
  - Control Weather to create a blizzard, partial concealment beyond 30 ft, then 20 ft, then 10 ft, etc

- Bugbears
  - Less happy with suicidal nature & will fuck off if a fight goes against them
  - Assassins going after exposed PCs and Cohorts
  - All teams are under Veil (hr/level) and Mind Blank from hags
  - Up to three teams, but no more than one per PC location

- Townsfolk
  - Enchanted by hags to do bad things
  - Control Monster: must win Cha test to make them do weird things, no suicidal orders but risky is fine, 9 days so plenty of time
  - Start innocent: "we can't close the door to my beloved from ??? farm" from weeping farmers and wives on main thoroughfare
  - Escalate to "lumbermen attacking the doors" and "poorly armed farmers charging masses of undead"

- Cacodaemon crows are hunting souls
  - Short list: Nikita, Yedder, Anatoli (fails), Kostia, Alaric, Gahdri, Niobe
  - Full round action once PC or Cohort is down
  - Covered by unkindnesses of ravens
  - Looking for escape paths, may find the circle

- When things look hopeless, start teleporting Seryy and Co in
  - Ideally, steal at least one soul first
  - Make "survive a few more rounds" believable
