PCs find that the Twins are working with the Guildmaster of the Prolichica Thieves (Marcellus)


Sam: What do you want?
- To protect the realm (?)
PCs: What's up with the dragons meeting?
- Don't meddle in the affairs of dragons.
Sam: When did you first discover the flower communications?
- Ballroom Blitz
PCs: ???
- ???
Sam: Who's been engaged in these flower communications?
- We know it went to both royalty and thieves, but we didn't follow up further.
- "Who's Welcomed The Gentry?"
- Tower of Fear can only be connected by Welcoming.
PCs: What are the Queen's weakness?
- Goblin rebellion has resources.
- Political behavior rather than just conquest.
- Shit got sped up before y'all were assholes.
Sam: What exactly did the church do with The White?
- The Church took the body, we don't know anything more.
PCs: Who have Welcomed The Gentry?
- Kores and Qermerseqeria thieves for sure, uncertain rumors of others.
Sam: How did you escape to the Goblin Market?
- PCs reveal knowledge of hidden portal spells. 
- Sam reveals shared knowledge, Queen's causing them to disappear.
PCs: How many elves are on the Queen's side?
- Unknown but they are the majority of Witchlords

Shulga interrupts, PCs notice all the elven-made jewelry.
- "But she's our friend!" (Kat quietly dies laughing in corner.)

Sam: What's up with you and slaves?
- Road to hell paved with good intentions.
PCs: What's up with Church corruption?
- Secret practices out of Moriloro.
Sam: What is your plan?
- We're still figuring it out. Maybe address the corruption?
- Sam reveals that Queen is older than him.
PCs: How many dragons on The Queen's side?
- None, we don't serve.
PCs: Why familiars?
- Freeing them, of course!

Gallows releases Mr. Bones from familiar bond.

Sam freely volunteers that hobgoblin population is massively grown, and Urden also prone to rebellion.
