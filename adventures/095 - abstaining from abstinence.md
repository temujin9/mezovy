# Plans
- Dylan believed they're being spied upon, and now they really are
  - Options
    - Divination spells vs Nondetection - CL check vs 11+CL of Nondetection
      - Scrying - need connection to targets, PCs didn't show up on radar until recently
      - Greater Prying Eyes - group cast by the Prince's coven, skin this as jackdaws
    - Familiars - lots of corvids, including duplicates of the Prince's cacodaemon
    - Vigilantes - just faces in the crowd in this army, until they act out of line
  - Who's sending them?
    - Prince of Crows? only at the last minute, so mostly familiars and Prying Eyes
    - Grey Eye - wants to know who could have driven the trio off
    - other followers or members of Queen's Cohort chain

- The coven appears somewhere safe, does Greater Prying Eyes to scope out the party
  - Prince decides discretion is better part of valor, unleashes Abstemious and fucks off to the Abyss for reinforcements
  - Abstemious completely underestimates the situation, and bloviates at and targets Anatoli for a lot of the episode
  - Anatoli gets a Sense Motive with easy DC to know what his plans are going to be
  - Round 1: Abstemious sends main assault after NPCs, sends greater lightning after PCs, and casts Hostile Juxtaposition on four mooks
  - Round 2: Abstemious calls his reserves to defend against PCs
  - Round 3: Abstemious casts Tidal Wave, then goes down?
  - Dylan gets the choice of absorbing Abstemious (respec as Neutral human Arcanist), killing him (stay as is), or something else
  - PCs succeed in finding the portal into The Queen's Woods

# Mass Combat
- PC success determines success
- PC action affects how much focus they get
  - Very visible / front-line: 3d2-3 attackers
  - Normally visible / back-line: 2d2-2 attackers
  - Sneaky / hiding: d2-1 attackers
- Most impressive action last turn gets attention from the leader
- Three rounds and out
  - A combat that is not clearly decided in three rounds is overkill
  - NPC action can account for a lot of ebb and flow
