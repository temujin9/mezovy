# Planning
## Current Tick
- ???
## Soon
- Revolt and subversion attempts are starting to pan out: lots of escaped slaves fleeing south to escape conscription
- Samvanzu sends agents to scope out Berko et al, maybe gets scoped
  - Also running trade south from Thorbuton to skip the war blockade
- Aligajievs are minor nobles who practice The Old Rites
  - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/irrisen-mirror-sight/
  - If they know, The Queen knows (eventually)
## Past Results
- Training heavier troops (bear hunters)
- Looking for non-Mezovian spellcasting traditions
- Diego used tax-free passage for merchants during negotiations to encourage delays, it's super effective
- Vovo pushes back with down-payment on the danegeld offered
- Queen offers magical backup for Berko's realm in exchange for Welcoming
- Seekers see two dragons landing on a single mountaintop in Compoundia, and then disappearing into the same cave mouth without fighting
- Diego stalls on negotiations, but puts safe access to the highway on table and offers free passage during negotiations
- Preparing strategically for hobgoblins attacking the Vogovans
- Warning and preparing the Vogovans for war with the Tsarina and/or hobgoblins
- Diego gets to talk to the Tsarina's representative
- Diego to explore his unorthodox and murder-related options regardless of the negotiations
- The Queen sends an envoy offering to make him a Duke if he'll flip
- Prominent dissidents from Mezovy invited to stay
- The Tsarina is gonna lose her shit about this
  - The hobgoblins retreat into the trods, she wheels west to the Yutch
- Establishing foothold at the northern fortress along with Vogovans
- Seekers remain hidden from Vogovans
- The Tsarina sends assassins and a close friend or family member is killed instead of Berko
- Get's "taken under the wing" of Komendant Vasyl Feodosijovych Denysenko of Kenland, shifted Vogovan balance of power
  - \[Unknown\] is Vasyl an agent of The Queen?
- Cossacks get free rein through Vogovan Yutchland, establish land-trade with Athamberingia (better than the fire-routes)
- Lets the Vogovans in, they wreck massive damage upon the Count's army
- Berko and three followers get the title of provincial governor
- Stanislav is only two hexes in after months of fighting
- Bulabar inform him of PCs trek through the trod
- Vogovan diplomatic envoy: would they consider becoming a province
- Enemy of enemy pays off: Lebosalk retakes the port town at the border
- Reaching out to the fae, met Bulabar riding Small lynxes
- Retreating into the mountains
- Holding the pass vs. the approaching army
- "Sincere" offer of help with wizardly problems
- Convinced the PCs to send aid (1BP)
- Entertained an envoy from The Queen
- Got help from Yarik: Artem assassinated, first assault blunted

# Notes
Highlanders with control of the main trading pass south and access to a trod. Regular leadership and the quiet but fierce love of his people.

## Initial Letter
Hello

I am Berko Yutchhead and I am want for your help. I have removed a noble who was cruel to us. We are simple farmers and hunter, he made us work until we broke bones and could walk no more just so he could get from our labor.  The cruel man has left but he will try and fight us, we just want our land and our food to eat and we must start an army, we want your help for it, please do so. We are no nobles, we can not do with out you.

Forever grateful,
Berko of the Yutch

## Allies
- Sula, elven advisor from Exilarchy of Air
- Vasyl, Kommendant of Kenland

## Enemy
- Count Stansilav Sergeev of Yutesh inherited sidelong from Count Artem Avretsniev. Artem's direct heir was replaced with a simulacrum that died at the Ballroom Blitz, which Artem hushed up.
- Stanislav belongs to the illustrious Avretsniev lineage, supposedly descended from \[mythical figure\]. It's famous patrilineal line includes the great poet Soloveitchik Avretsniev (lit: songbird), the famous fencer and swordfighter Serhei Mihayevich, and the esteemed former Yevgeni Avretsniev the Great, who traded some of his massive war plunders for massive tracts of farmland more than 300 years ago, including the then sparse Yutch hill tracts.

## Enemy of my Enemy
- The Fekhtovnik (lit: fencer) Counts of Drozelk believe their ancestor, Count Petr Fekhtovnik, was cheated in a famous match against Serhei Mihayevich Sergeev of Musdarbat. Petr disarmed Mihayevich, who then kicked Petr in the arm and recollected his saber; the controversy turned violent at another match, and Petr nearly lost an arm to infection. This event almost 90 years ago has left the clans bitter and even unwilling to directly speak, though the Fekhtovnik nobles have less power but a strong army, though reined in by restrictions.
- Grand Duke Grisha "the Brave" Gusev of Amjarsuaq believes his sister is being beaten by Stanislav's elder brother, Grand Duke Afonasei "the Black-Bearded" Sergeev of Musdarbat.
- A recent power clash by the deceased Artem Avretsniev of Yutesh over possession of a river trading port on the border of Lebosalk. Lebosalk is ruled by the Shanievsky line, known for their wealthy trade backround. The Shanievsky will want to win back what they consider theirs, and plan to test the resolve of the young nobles thrust into the leadership of the great but fading Avretsniev line.
