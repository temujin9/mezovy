    Hello

    I am Berko Yutchhead and I am want for your help. I have removed a noble who was cruel to us. We are simple farmers and hunter, he made us work until we broke bones and could walk no more just so he could get from our labor.  The cruel man has left but he will try and fight us, we just want our land and our food to eat and we must start an army, we want your help for it, please do so. We are no nobles, we can not do with out you.

    Forever grateful,
    Berko of the Yutch

Got help from Yarik who hired an assassin, not understanding that the cousin whose eye they took stood next in line to the Yutesh throne.

Regular leadership and the quiet but fierce love of his people.



# Enemy
- Count Stansilav Sergeev of Yutesh inherited sidelong from Count Artem Avretsniev. Artem's direct heir was replaced with a simulacrum that died at the Ballroom Blitz, which Artem hushed up.
- Stanislav belongs to the illustrious Avretsniev lineage, supposedly descended from [mythical figure]. It's famous patrilineal line includes the great poet Soloveitchik Avretsniev (lit: songbird), the famous fencer and swordfighter Serhei Mihayevich, and the esteemed former Yevgeni Avretsniev the Great, who traded some of his massive war plunders for massive tracts of farmland more than 300 years ago, including the then sparse Yutch hill tracts.

## Enemy of my Enemy
- The Fekhtovnik (lit: fencer) Counts of Drozelk believe their ancestor, Count Petr Fekhtovnik, was cheated in a famous match against Serhei Mihayevich Sergeev of Musdarbat. Petr disarmed Mihayevich, who then kicked Petr in the arm and recollected his saber; the controversy turned violent at another match, and Petr nearly lost an arm to infection. This event almost 90 years ago has left the clans bitter and even unwilling to directly speak, though the Fekhtovnik nobles have less power but a strong army, though reined in by restrictions.
- Grand Duke Grisha "the Brave" Gusev of Amjarsuaq believes his sister is being beaten by Stanislav's elder brother, Grand Duke Afonasei "the Black-Bearded" Sergeev of Musdarbat.
- A recent power clash by the deceased Artem Avretsniev of Yutesh over possession of a river trading port on the border of Lebosalk. Lebosalk is ruled by the Shanievsky line, known for their wealthy trade backround. The Shanievsky will want to win back what they consider theirs, and plan to test the resolve of the young nobles thrust into the leadership of the great but fading Avretsniev line.
