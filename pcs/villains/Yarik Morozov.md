# Notes
The new ruler of Daydah, having married into the family. Actually an up-and-coming thief in the newly revitalized Thieves Guild. Originally from Prolichia, fled there under an assumed name.

Followers have cursed suicide-pact rings: they put them on in front of him, and can only take them off again safely with the mission completed. Otherwise they get a Phantasmal Killer and an Animate Dead, or a Disintegrate and a Gust of Wind for higher value targets, and their family is well taken care of.

Has Ring of Mind Blank.

## Goal
It's not something overly complicated, but my current goal is to gain complete control over the criminal underworld in the southwestern corner of Mezony and set Yarik up as the undisputed ruler of the underworld in the region.

While Yarik is doing this, Viktor is gonna keep making connections (trade, political and otherwise) and generally doing everything he can in his powers to make Daydah prosper and play the part of the good, honest man that hasn’t let his success get to his head and forget his humble origins.

My hopes are that eventually Yarik will be powerful enough to fabricate a crisis severe enough in one or more of the surrounding counties that would eventually “force” Viktor to move his forces in to contain the situation and “temporarily” seize control of the county (because, unfortunately, it seems like in the midst of the crisis the entire ruling family of the county tragically lost their lives) but that is still way off.
