Character: Yarik Morozov
Player: reinbach
Class: Vigilante?
Alias: Count Viktor Borovkov

The new ruler of Daydah, having married into the family. Actually an up-and-coming thief in the newly revitalized Thieves Guild. Originally from Prolichia, fled there under an assumed name.

Followers have cursed suicide-pact rings: they put them on in front of him, and can only take them off again safely with the mission completed. Otherwise they get a Phantasmal Killer and an Animate Dead, or a Disintegrate and a Gust of Wind for higher value targets, and their family is well taken care of.
