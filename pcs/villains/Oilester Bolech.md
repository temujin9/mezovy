Character: Oilester Bolech III
Player: dicesmasher
Class: Wizard
Group: ???

Wizard who escaped the clutches of The Queen and Crow Prince, but was driven mad by his time transformed into a book.

Expy of [Halister Blackcloak](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halaster_Blackcloak).

First encounter will be of him as a potato farmer, in a village with a bunch of weak demons and goofy traps. He's got apprentices he sprung as well, all also mad.

From Bolechnikov (placement on map TBD), has been mind-fucked into thinking he's a Rovenkian potato farmer. Will figure that out sometime through contact with PCs.
