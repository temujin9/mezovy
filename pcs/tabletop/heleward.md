Questions:
- What diplomatic thing? Courtier to the prince.
- Why snub the Tsarina's heir? Arthia doesn't have much reason to honor, doesn't trust Mezovy with an important child.

- What's up with his family? They presumed him dead at the Dearth.
- Which noble family? Schawzen (German), somewhere northwest Arthia
- Tiefling blood? Yes, with Soul Seer (Deathwatch at will), & Pass For Human (both human and outsider)

- [Ask PC] Who did he save and have bad romance with?
  - This is kinda the opening plot of Alladin, inverted: he's the cooped up prince, and she's a cunning low-born female
  - gnome? halfling? elf? goblin?
  - highwayman/hunter/ranger/druid w/ animal companion?
  - wizard/sorcerer/witch w/ a familiar?
- Where is the bad romance now?
- How'd he get hooked up with the PCs?



GM Notes:
- Why both weal and woe in asking about in Puryev? Woe might be outing as non-Church, but what's weal?
  - Weal is that Dain deigns (see what I did there) to approach Heleward more directly
- Made an Oracle by Dian Cecht - the fae-folk (Celtic) god of healing
  - "The Morrígú bore a son of terrible aspect, and Dain counseled that he should be destroyed in his infancy"
  - Not a local human deity, ergo did it because it hoped to get leverage with a human follower
  - Willingness to save bad romance at personal cost helped convince Dain
  - Explains why it's been cagey so far: feeling Heleward out before revelation
  - Also brings in other fae proto-deities
    - Miach - twin son of Dain Cecht, killed by father in jealousy of healing skills
    - Oirmiach - twin brother of Miach
    - Airmed - healing, herbalism, sister of Oirmiach and Miach
    - Others TBD

Life Mystery

got heleward's backstory more fleshed out, i think
[large number]th son of a minor arthian noble, grew up isolated on account of not being very noble, sent to rovank for a diplomatic thing, possibly as some sort of calculated snub like "it's not politically appropriate to send nobody, so here's almost nobody, haha, fuck you"
or if that's not the kind of thing you do to the rovankian noblefolk, then possibly just a member of a larger party
sneaks out at night, meets someone who doesn't know who he is, has a grand old time, whole new world of possibilities blossoming before his eyes, etc
bad thing happens, the someone is gravely injured, cries for help & makes extravagant promises to any god who will listen, gets oracleized, saves the someone
starts a relationship with that person whilst also having to do oracle things, relationship doesn't go well, heleward scarpers
he's going to tell himself that he's doing it to keep them safe because he lives a dangerous life and such
and probably has convinced himself mostly
and that once he does enough grunt work for whoever gave him the power he can go back and play house
but really that's not why, it's a lot because being with someone who saved you from certain death is a fucked up power dynamic to start with
like how do you yell at someone for putting their feet on the couch when they plucked you from the reaper's embrace
and maybe they weren't really suited to be together in the first place but just kinda felt like they had to
anyway, after that he's just been kinda drifting, doing whatever comes up that seems like oracle work
probably a lot of clearing out undead and healing folk since his powers are especially well suited to that
eventually the orcs or whoever told him that some people were trying to break a curse and he was like "yep, that sounds like a thing" and went to help




Big plan: find out what power was responsible for his powers and ask them what he's supposed to do for them
"Nothing" might be a fun answer for that one, like it would parallel what Heleward did for his someone and an obligation was felt that didn't necessarily exist
And maybe he's been seeing the things he's doing as tasks sent to him by some higher power but it's more that he is noticing people's problems because now he has the ability to do something about them
