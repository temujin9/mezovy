Questions:
- What minor family is Shiny a cadet branch of?

The second son of a long forgotten branch of a minor family, Shiny knew they were destined for “Not bothering anyone overmuch” and “Staying out of the way”. They rebelled, as overly indulged young persons do, by drinking too much and causing trouble in places that already have too much.

They spent so much time in those places they started to notice what actually happened there. That combined with a penchant for violence and some sense that there should be a balance to the world led them to join the guard. But the guard was a meanspirited tiny place where the real job was “Not bothering anyone overmuch” and “Staying out of the way” when it came to the scales being out of whack. 

Shiny is deeply grateful to our patron, they believe that in Serhii’s domain justice actually matters and there is a real opportunity for the proper mix of curiosity and assertiveness to tip things in the direction of good. That is a rare thing in the world, and Shiny is here for it.
