RIGHT. The last character question you asked was "What would you die for?" For which I answered, "Nothing." Which sounded boring. The question isn't what would Gahdri die for. It's; what would she break for? And the answer is Velorolobo. Seryy saved her; charged her with a leadership role; then left. But the debt lingers, and the people are her friends. Additionally I should hint, the goblins will be part of Velorolobo, too.



Gahdri sees inequity everywhere, having traveled probably farther than most members of the party, and with a more varied assortment of companions. As we've seen already, despite even the proof of the wand of "Detect Good", her feelings on the matter of "Evil Humanoids" or "Monster Races" is just that: a prime example of what happens with resource scarcity. If slavery is to exist in the realm in the way that it does, as punishment, then to release the slaves afterward with nothing gained only exacerbates the inequity. She wants to see reform, and thinks that fair treatment would prove that the "Evil Races" aren't capital-E EVIL, just beaten down into brutism.
Secondary to that is of course The Axe of Perun. Or, one particular sect or cult of Perun, as she is willing to give the benefit of the doubt that the entirety of the clergy of Perun would not condone what she suffered through. There will be no holds barred as far as she's concerned if any Perun worshiper actually reveals that torture like that is doctrine. She will absolutely encourage purging Velorolobo of the Axe if that holds true, if not the greater Tsardom.
The third big plan is nebulous at the moment, but is waiting to be called out, so I'll sit on that a bit longer.



All right. So lets say that Gahdri is from Le-Aia, a Shire in the Principality of Eraia. It's surrounded by Aga, Mundia, Lemoizia, Erga, and Betia just so you know right where it is and can look for lots of things at the same time to find it. It might easily be taken to heart that Gahdri came from a rather restrictive culture, given the way that she dresses, but that's not so. Her parents (well, one bio and one step-father) realized the rather massive amount of potential in her and doubled down on her schooling. She excelled more than anyone thought she would because in addition to being OH so smart, she was also strong. And agile. And durable. This didn't make her any friends though. Being better just got her beaten down by the rest of the class. The good thing about her shire was that it wasn't a theocracy. The bad part was that it was surrounded by them, and being the best of her school meant that her choices would be taken away from her for the good of the shire. She left home (and by left home I mean ran away before being assigned as an adviser, or wife, or anything she didn't feel like doing because why should someone else make that choice for her) and wended her way northward towards the Tsardom, and adventure. As she moved through the southern realms she shed her culture by degrees, tried to blend, worked her way north via caravans both as a guard or a minor magical talent, and basically gained an appreciation for the vastness of country. Until she grew arrogant enough to think she could handle wandering on her own. Somewhere between Minech and Velorolobo, about 5 years ago and definitely before or right after the Tsarina granted her children their counties, Gahdri ran afoul of a group of anti-magic zealots. Specifically, they followed the belief that only divine magic was Good magic, and any that performed arcane magic were clearly devil or fiend worshipers, and should be tortured until they abandoned their "magic."

For GM purposes this group (or one of these groups of many) could be located in any of the following: Perech, Inech, Kores, Drozelk, Olenkia, or Ossavin. They tortured her with acid, healing only to prevent death. They tried to burn her at the stake, and failed to kill her. And then they dragged her away from their places of torture and worship, and buried her alive. She managed only to get her head and arm above ground before passing out, and that was when Seryy's entourage passed her by, on tour or on his way to Velorolobo, and he saw her. Her wounds were too severe not to scar, and to hide them, she fell back to her nations style of clothes. But because he saved her, and he saw the good in her, she stayed with him. He is the only one in the company that knows the full story of why she was found half dead and buried. And those are the reasons why she gets to have her ring of mind shielding, and her silly, pretty, art piece that looks like a skull. 

The group's name is "The Axe of Perun". They were all wearing freshly carved wooden tokens in the shape of a bearded axe. The attack and rescue was in Inech, as Seryy was returning through there on a hunting vacation on his way to being given the county of Velorolobo.
