What is his guild like? Royal Guild: broader reach, less respected, less overall resources

Was apprenticed to Dusky Snobs, but was caught snooping around in Forbidden Texts, and attacked a guard. Went to jail, got bailed out by Royal Guild in exchange for signing up.


- Gave Dylan access to a Royal Guild card deck
  - With apologies for "gathering necessary info rudely in these uncertain times"
  - Way to "phone a friend" in hard situations
  - Plot hook source
