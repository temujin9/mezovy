# Changes
- All levels stack, not just "conforming" levels
- Only add better stats with a +1 CR, otherwise add +4/+2/+0/+0/-2/-4

# Rules
ECL modifiers:
  Class levels  CL
  CR            +CR
  1st Level CR  +CR-1
  PC wealth     +1
  Good stats    +1
PC levels can only be taken if CR >= 1 or Good stats
All PCs must take "PC wealth" (unless the setting)

# Examples
F.G Owl Bard 10: ECL 17 = 10 (level) +6 (CR) +1 (good wealth)

PC ghoul fighter 1: ECL 3 = 1 (level) +1 (CR) +1 (good wealth)
PC ghoul child fighter 1: ECL 3 = 1 (level) +0 (CR: -1 child) +1 (good stats) +1 (good wealth)
PC ghoul child warrior 1: ECL 2 = 1 (level) +0 (CR: -1 child) +1 (good wealth)
PC ghoul child: ECL 2 = +1 (CR) +1 (good wealth)
PC ghoul child: ECL 1 = +0 (CR: -1 child) +1 (good wealth)

NPC ghoul child warrior 1: ECL 1 = +1 (level) +0 (CR: -1 child)
PC human fighter 1: ECL 1 = +1 (level) +1 (stats) +1 (wealth) -2 (1st Level CR)
