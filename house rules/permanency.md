Permanency can be enchanted into items, but its use is very specific:
- If it is the -only- spell in that item, it can be used on any spell, but user must pay cost
- If it shares space with other castable spells on the item, it can only be used on those spells
- The cost of the Permanency may be included (at 50x/100x cost) only for spells castable by the item
- If there are multiple spells, the material cost of each type of Permanency (but not the base spell) costs separately
