# Portals
Forbidden lore, as knowing about the easy ritual to break a lock, or The Old Rites, would make mundane people far more likely to enact them. In addition, several church practices (only approved songs, no dancing) are in place to prevent accidentally breaking a portal lock.

  - Permanently bound to self or animals as part of ritual mages attempts to have more immediate power
  - Bred true because D&D evolution is effectively Lamarkian
  - Evidence: hags (SLA, ritual, not caster), lamia (SLA and spells)
- Spellcasting
  - Cha-based SLAs to rote performances imitating them (Bards)
  - Gods learn how to grant spells to charismatics (Oracles)
  - Gods learn how to grant spells to the wise (Clerics)
  - Patrons steal the trick from them for the smart (Witches)
  - Sorcerers learn how to access more magic than Bards without patron or Perform
  - Witches learn how to share spells (to make up for Sorcerer breadth issue)
  - Invention with K: Arcana/Nature/Planes/Religion and Spellcraft DC 20+2*SL
  - Learning: Spellcraft DC 15+SL, 1/week

  - Descended from Sorcerers (no patronage), Witches (Int-based, share spells) and Craft Scroll
  - Wizards learn how to record spells and work without patronage
  - Creeps out witch folk, because of its high mutability and lack of social controls

If spell-casting can be nerfed by the Codex, then everything past Spellcraft is constructed and destructable
- Shades of Cixin Liu, huh? Also the Dr Who written canon, anchoring of the thread to hedge out magical precursors
- Who built it? 
  - The Towers is the obvious answer, though they hardly benefited alone
  - Many extraplanar entities had an interest in it happening, but that doesn't give a clear answer
  - Perhaps some trickster deity got it all lined up so that all three groups (towers, patrons, and deities) were pulling for it?
- How deeply can the Codex freeze things?
  - In the triple-trick explanation: the three will never trust each other on that level again, and the hobgoblins would be on it like white on rice
  - Does it shatter it irrevocably? Are there fragments that survive in magic items, ley line nexuses, and so on?



# History
- Demihuman Kingdoms
  - Lots of small kingdoms like the Compoundia, slowly conquered by the witchlords
  - Some were able to hold out, the rest fell into the rule of the witchlords
  - Desperate demihumans turned to the younger human race, and their newly invented wizardry
- The Hobgoblin Wars
  - Earliest of the wars to found and stabilize the current range of Mezovy
  - Wizards Guilds are recognized by The Crown, in exchange for their military service
  - The Church grudgingly accepts them, but politically undermines them
- Today
  - No tower has produced an Ipsissimus (9th level caster) in more than three generations
  - Several pretenders to the title have happened both before and since, with their waning
  - War magic is poorly studied, since the last perfunctory war (Vogovo) was more than fifty years ago
  - Portal magic is lost to Mezovy, having been systematically destroyed by the witchlords over the centuries
