# Portals
Forbidden lore, as knowing about the easy ritual to break a lock, or The Old Rites, would make mundane people far more likely to enact them. In addition, several church practices (only approved songs, no dancing) are in place to prevent accidentally breaking a portal lock.

# Prehistory
## Ritual magic
  - Invention: Int/Wis/Cha check DC 15+SL => invent 9th level from scratch DC 24
    => Stat 18 (+4), ~13.5 tries @ 9 wk/mo per => ~2 1/3 to ~10 yrs, equal odds of crit failure
    => Stat 20 (+5), ~6.5 tries @ 9 wk/mo per => ~1 to ~5 yrs, ~30% odds of crit failure
    => Stat 22 (+6), ~4 tries @ 9 wk/mo per => ~3/4 to ~3 yrs, ~20% odds of crit failure
  - Learning: Int/Wis/Cha check DC 10+SL from willing teacher
  - Success: various, DC 28+SL+/-mods
## Master Craftsman enchantment
  - Success: Craft/Profession, DC 15+SL => DC 24 @9th, correct CL gives +5, can use similar item for +5
  - Only Craft Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item
## Spellcraft skill
## Spell-like Abilities
  - Enchanted via item creation feat (Wondrous or something new), using Profession: Farmer or Yenta for breeding
  - Permanently bound to self or animals as part of ritual mages attempts to have more immediate power
  - Bred true because D&D evolution is effectively Lamarkian
  - Evidence: hags (SLA, ritual, not caster), lamia (SLA and spells)
## Spellcasting
  - Cha-based SLAs to rote performances imitating them (Bards)
  - Gods learn how to grant spells to charismatics (Oracles)
  - Gods learn how to grant spells to the wise (Clerics)
  - Patrons steal the trick from them for the smart (Witches)
  - Sorcerers learn how to access more magic than Bards without patron or Perform
  - Witches learn how to share spells (to make up for Sorcerer breadth issue)
  - Invention with K: Arcana/Nature/Planes/Religion and Spellcraft DC 20+2*SL
  - Learning: Spellcraft DC 15+SL, 1/week
  - Success: automatic unless interfered with (Concentration check => d20+CL+Stat)
## Spellcaster enchantment
  - Success: Spellcraft, DC 15+SL => DC 24 @9th, correct CL gives +5, can use item/spell for +5
  - Brew Potion <- Cauldron hex (single use, shareable)
  - Craft Wondrous Item -> Forge Ring (two extra slots)
  - Craft Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item -> Craft Rod (mixed use, caster tools)
  - Craft Wondrous Item -> Craft Staff (spell trigger, charges)
  - Craft Staff, Brew Potion -> Craft Scroll (better spell range for single use, spell trigger)
  - Craft Staff, Craft Scroll -> Craft Wand (cheaper per use, no recharge needed)
## Memorization
Wizard, Heka, Living Grimoire Inquisitor, Archivist Cleric, Alchemist
  - Descended from Sorcerers (no patronage), Witches (Int-based, share spells) and Craft Scroll
  - Wizards learn how to record spells and work without patronage
  - Creeps out witch folk, because of its high mutability and lack of social controls

## Codex Effects
If spell-casting can be nerfed by the Codex, then everything past Spellcraft is constructed and destructable
- Shades of Cixin Liu, huh? Also the Dr Who written canon, anchoring of the thread to hedge out magical precursors

### Who built it? 
  - The Towers is the obvious answer, though they hardly benefited alone
  - Many extraplanar entities had an interest in it happening, but that doesn't give a clear answer
  - Perhaps some trickster deity got it all lined up so that all three groups (towers, patrons, and deities) were pulling for it?
### How deeply can the Codex freeze things?
  - In the triple-trick explanation: the three will never trust each other on that level again, and the hobgoblins would be on it like white on rice
  - Does it shatter it irrevocably? Are there fragments that survive in magic items, ley line nexuses, and so on?



# History
## Demihuman Kingdoms
  - Lots of small kingdoms like the Compoundia, slowly conquered by the witchlords
  - Some were able to hold out, the rest fell into the rule of the witchlords
  - Desperate demihumans turned to the younger human race, and their newly invented wizardry
## The Hobgoblin Wars
  - Earliest of the wars to found and stabilize the current range of Mezovy
  - Wizards Guilds are recognized by The Crown, in exchange for their military service
  - The Church grudgingly accepts them, but politically undermines them
## Today
  - No tower has produced an Ipsissimus (9th level caster) in more than three generations
  - Several pretenders to the title have happened both before and since, with their waning
  - War magic is poorly studied, since the last perfunctory war (Vogovo) was more than fifty years ago
  - Portal magic is lost to Mezovy, having been systematically destroyed by the witchlords over the centuries
