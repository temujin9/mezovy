# Next tick
- Yarik
  - If he tries another strike on Mila, his agent is caught by the hidden bodyguard
  - He's going all-in against Mila and crew

- Berko
  - Reaching out to the hobgoblins, they are trying to determine if they Yutch are loyal to The Queen or not
  - If he reveals they are not, hobgoblins will try to verify somehow (Zone of Truth?), and if valid let them in

- The Tsarina rallies (got to 10 on her villain clock)
  - Tsarina: Holy Warrior Priestess of Law is out in full force
  - Forestalls the Council acting against Seryy somehow (quorum failure, temp knockout of an opposed member?)
  - Akichi just pulled Athamberingia into the war on the Tsarina's side, and she'll make hay of that
    - Blockade cuts off Yutch support while she recaptures the , forcing Berko into a rough choice
  - It's not going to be enough on its own, but it should give the PCs a chance at true diplomacy (or a late "side with Tsarina" move)


# Next game(s)
- What did Ragnar do in Prolichica while the shit was going down in Velerolobo
  - some shady shit tbd, versus Yarik's attackers
  - Figured out that Mila is in charge


# Soon
- The Queen wakes up every day and casts Perm. Curse Land on someplace that spurned her
  - https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Horror%20Hazards&Category=Horror%20Environments x6 up to 10CR
  - Ugusuk, Tuttaarsuaqaq, Yutivl spared for now (she hasn't learned yet)

- Who freed the wayang from the book? It takes a Miracle / another 9th level splash
  - They bought a scroll from The Shepherd? Means scrolls of Wish are on the table.
  - Many of Jerry's NPC friends helped in a ceremonial casting? Means a ritual of debinding / Wish is on the table.
  - The Wayang is a devotee of anti-Lolth, she got him out? Means praying for a Miracle is on the table.
  - A weak bit of all of the above managed to crack him, maybe in stages?
  - A deity (Veles? anti-Lolth?) broke him out of their own accord for their own purposes?

- The Towers are an infighting mess over Towersfall
  - Half are well aligned with the Tsarina, half sneering at them through prejudice or misinformation
  - All are occupied with dispelling the Curse Land
  - Royal Wizards - Cannon Fodder - for, firmly aligned with Tsarina and PCs on this
  - Uhlinberg - Ditchdiggers - for, but reduced to beggars with rich purses, which they wish to protect from other guilds
  - Topolh - Snowballs - for, Rovenk is in their territory
  - Maskar - Dusky Snobs - for, loves Royal Family
  - Prolichica - Shopkeeps - for, dislikes Royal Wizards, but royals just repudiated The Queen
  - Daydah - Mummers - against, hate Royal Family and Royal Wizards
  - Sioraneq - Brouhahas - against, secretly sympathizers with The Queen
  - Oreskoere - Gravediggers - against, loves Daydah and agrees with them
  - Polyn - Sheepsquints - against, dislikes the Church
  - Auseq - Vagrants - against, dislikes Daydah but hates the Church

- Does The Queen discover the flower language insult now that it'd be a problem for Lord Hob?
  - Khrekaan may know this, may tell PCs?
  - Or is that something that the goblins can drop when time is right?
  - Maybe Queen's treatment of Lord Hob and his subsequent hiding of things from her has helped rebels tremendously

- Queen plans to make another Tower, this time with unbreakable CL and core which can be reopened from inside (w/ a no-magic one as an "airlock")
  - PCs need to know this is coming, so they can try to prevent it and so the drumbeat can be started

- The Traitor is being rushed into marriage to Prince of Crows, no time to think on consequences
  - Raag was looking to prevent this, maybe he gets word in time?
  - This likely puts the PCs up against the Prince, which is CR 19+
  - Ergo this shouldn't get to them until closer to the end

- Oilester is a Darkness wild card
  - did he learn of this in time to take advantage, raiding Uhlinberg's remains while the PCs fought the demons?
  - or does he show up in Hart and collect demons for his own army?
  - how lucid is he about the fronts of this war? can he identify the demon tower as the queen's work? is he a potential TTPC ally? who could tell?

- Gallows wondered out loud which Demon Lord she was in league with, we should reward that with info soon
  - How would Ghadri or Yedder discover this?
  - Do the goblins tell them this?

- Ukpik is impressed by the Towersfall fight and the odd self-sacrifice for Akichi, willing to consider negotiations

- Dylan believes they're being scryed upon: not yet, but sooooon

- Tokra-expies are a circle of changeling witches which refuse to turn hag, and who fight the hags secretly
  - A source of hag lore, plot hooks, and maybe some magic
  - PCs are introduced by Uncle Ivan the witch
  - This needs to happen in a separate game from the one with the goblin negotiations

- Ducal council rumblings
  - 10 total (9 currently), current ruler breaks ties, meaning she had thin lock (5v5) before and now doesn't
  - State of war and country is not great, at all
  - Seryy and Tsarina are against alliance with the Exilarchy of Air thanks to PCs / Royal Wizards
    - Tsarina
    - Tsesarevich Seryy Anton Kuznetsov the Longshot of Rovenk Margrave
    - Grand Duke Markus Venceslav Pasternak of Orarfutaqia Margrave is Caine: not for Tsarina, but against Queen
    - Grand Duke Grisha Gusev of Amjarsuaq Margrave loves Royal Wizards, dislikes Amjarsuaq elves
    - ~~Grand Duke Stanislav Fedorov of Bereria Margrave~~ is newly deceased thanks to curse, appointing new one will take time
  - others (who?) are calling for an alliance with Exilarchy
    - Grand Duke Å½arko Yuriy Kuznetsov of Drutk Margrave is influenced by wife and mother-in-law, hates own family
    - Grand Duchess Zvezdana Diana Kuznetsov of Bebia Margrave dislikes Seryy, has established ties
    - Grand Duke Afonasei Sergeev of Musdarbat Margrave dislikes / hates Royal Wizards, dislikes The Church
  - On the fence but tempted toward anti-Tsarina side
    - Grand Duke Modest Sokolov of Khujunfu Margrave dislikes Royal Wizards
    - Grand Duke Esfir Vyacheslav Kohut of Inech County wants to give up and join before its too late
  - Someone is gonna leak Seryy's wife's infertility, causing vote to force him out of his Margrave and thus off council (who/when?)
    - Ideal for Queen result is that the succession be given to Agnessa, which tips the council heavily in her favor (5v3)
    - If that works, eventually the Exilarchy folks will call for a forced succession
  - How do the ghouls tie into this?
    - They are Illuminati behind the Mezovian throne
    - They idly supported the current Tsarina because she is bidable, has ensured succession, and the war was producing a feast
    - They didn't really care much beforehand, because it didn't threaten the realm until more recently
    - The Ghastly Ecclesiarch is trying to decide whether it's better to let to let The Queen win

- Alter Ego subplot for Dylan
  - The trigger is Prince of Crows releasing the retconned wizards, including Abstemious
  - Reveal that his cohort and cohort's cohort were assigned to him by RWInt due to his false identification with old school mates
  - Abstemious does what to who in the Arcanists guild?
  - End-game option: merge with Abstemious (becoming human true neutral Arcanist w/ bad rep) or kill him (remain construct Sorcerer)
  - Use the quick-swap ability from Arcanist to maximum effect?



# Endgame
https://gnomestew.com/how-to-have-an-epic-campaign-in-three-acts-part-3-of-3/
- Bring back memorable NPCs
  - TODO: run through the adventure logs, see who looks good
  - Rugov (Lady Frost) came back and got soul-sucked
  - Old PCs: Jon and Lurko's characters
    - Jon is keeping ???'s court free, making her ironically a decent succession chance
    - Lurko is leading a flying squad that has done ???

- Goblins and PCs *could* force a drow revolt against The Queen
  - She's a thousand-plus years old and hasn't leveled appreciably? She started out nearly this strong in backstory?
  - She's obligated to punish failure, and also doomed if she punishes too much (20%)
  - She's can punish a few times before killing, and kill sparingly, but it still adds up
  - 20% of 9368 is 1874, x3 is 5622 total failures and punishments, if she last leveled 500 years ago that's 1/month or less, 1 death/quarter
  - Current situation may have increased that base rate considerably ... and she doesn't have a meter to watch

- Climactic battle needs chaotic setting (larger battle, interesting terrain, etc)
  - The many realms of the Queen's Castle
- Blow something up at the end
  - The Queen's Palace?
  - the Empire?
  - the Spellweb?
  - all of the above?

- Elf blood makes goblins into hobgoblins
  - If Ter Krekhan learns the full relationship between drow and hags, he will have an "only really need elf blood" realization
  - This is the final part of the puzzle that he needs: hobgoblins could then farm from any elven population, not just the hags & changelings
  - This tips the balance solidly toward hobgoblin victory, as they can finally massively overpopulate from goblin ranks

# Regular considerations
- [B-plot progress](b-plot.md)
- [Rolobo's library](locations/castle.gm.md)
- Followers
  - Dylan
    - High level spy in Tsarina's court
    - Two first levels on each sibling (the ones at Puryev have been blown)
    - One first level at each tower
    - Twenty first level scouts on river and road from Velerolobo to Prolichica
    - 10ish exploring looking for artifact in the fae lands
  - Kat
    - Most protecting the trod forts (Faceplant, Redcap L3)
    - Some watching the 4th tower
    - Some watching the Painted Glen portals
  - Gallows
    - Goblins and others, scouting the trods, preparing to infiltrate hobgoblins
- Allies
  - Royal Wizard Intelligence: looking in the library, or provide +2 for aid another
  - Raaginald
    - Hinnton
    - Whisper network
    - High-level rogue in Tsarina's Court


# Pacing/Timing
- Target CR is currently 19/18/17 (ACL+5 if 6+ PCs, ACL+4 if 4-5, ACL+3 if 3 PCs)
- Target is 4.5 levels per year for next two years
- PCs confront Queen at 17th or 18th level
- Meta: Prep one scene or one round of big combat for every 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay




# Further ideas
- Desired Scenes / Encounters
  - Confrontation with Anatoli the Abstemious
  - Second encounter with the Mad Archmage
  - The Traitor is revealed
  - Confronting The Queen. Could involve digs about ghoul Illuminati?
  - Gahdri raised to Ipsissimus
  - Raag achieves success in business
- Minotaurs made from eating the flying aurochs
- When the going gets desperate, the Tsarina will start conscripting slaves en-mass
- So where is The Queen's father? He lies dead asleep and dreaming in his underwater house. She's merely the Princess Regent there.
  - Could have a Nanny Ogg wakes C'thulu subplot if the PCs want
- Female drow witches can become hags without hagbinding, if they want
  - Drow witches are the ultimate progenitors of hags, via this process
  - Drow blood might substitute for changeling blood, which can substitute (at some penalty) for hag blood
  - Regular elf blood also works, at even greater penalty (e.g. takes more of it, or ritual is at minuses)
  - Ritual which allows it shares elements with the ritual to make hobgoblins
  - This replaces Lolth with hags and witch Patrons, which implies she is one (on Shadow?)
    - Damhan: CG spidery goddess of destiny and artistry, kinda like Arachne + Athena
    - Oh hey is this the spider deity that wove the spellweb? Makes her magic her domain as well.
- Plane of air
  - https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Plane_of_Air
  - Required beating the Djinn

    - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding/
    - https://www.aonprd.com/MagicGenieSeals.aspx
    - Can't actually grant Wish spells, just willing to work their way to freedom
  - Also silver/white/cloud dragons
- Plane of Shadow
  - Thematically more aligned with evil outer planes? Dislike
  - Both order and chaos could use Shadow travel (ala Amber)?
  - Cosmologically this is the borderlands between negative material plane and 
  - Underdark is the heavy overlap between this and the plane of earth?
- The Queen has also collected several other types of portal magic
  - Magic mirror portals which can be moved, linking back to the Hall of Mirrors: expensive, harder to make
  - Elf doors ala that one animated Netflix TV show
- Goblin pikey merchant, selling (goblin) dog meat: "d'ya like dags?"
- What's with all the birds and bird names
  - [The Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(play)) references: Nephelokokkygia aka Cloud-Cookoo-Land
  - Maybe one of the more prevalent planes creators is a bird fae
  - Maybe birds and elves/fae/drow are connected somehow
  - The Sea Tsar is a very "turn into birds" story
  - [Language of the birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)
  - The Queen is ruler of the planes of Air and Shadow, birds would be prevalent in the former
- You put https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Kladenets over the mantle in the first act, you have to use it in the third
- Fae folk piloting warforged-like mech-suits against humans
