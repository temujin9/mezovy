# Next game
- Prolichica, check in on Martsell
- Meet with the goblin rebellion
  - Humans stole the Inuk goblinoids thunderbolt iron, leading to their conquest by the hags?
    - On display in Prolichica?
    - ala Robert Peary and the Inuit: stole their only metal source
    - Comes up during peace negotiations with the hobgoblins
  - If the PCs leak to Ter Krekhan the nature of the relationship between drow, changelings, and hags, he will have an "only really need elf blood" realization
    - This is the final part of the puzzle that he needs: hobgoblins could then farm from any elven population, not just the hags & changelings
    - This tips the balance toward hobgoblin victory, as they can finally massively overpopulate from goblin ranks

# TODO
- Aligajievs are minor nobles who practice The Old Rites
  - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/irrisen-mirror-sight/
  - If they know, The Queen knows (eventually)
  - One of the is factotum between Yarik and Berko asking about RW Int spell-sharing right now

- How mad is the Queen? 
  - Just a lil bit
  - What does she do in response?
    - Plan to make it again, with unbreakable CL and core which can be reopened from inside (w/ no-magic as a "lock")
    - Get revenge on the organizers
      "Who fucking orchestrated that debacle which MAY COST ME MY BETROTHAL?!"
      "Royal Wizards and Axe of Perun."
      "They must go. NOW! ... They clash with the drapes."
    - Accelerate plans: push all who've responded toward a Welcoming
    - Deploy higher level assets now that the target is softened up and alliances clear
    - Send the witches who were running the Tarasque after the PCs?
  - Does she discover the flower language thing now that it'll be a problem for Lord Hob?
    - Or is that something that the goblins can drop when time is right?
    - Maybe Queen's treatment of Lord Hob and his subsequent hiding of things from her has helped rebels tremendously
    - Khrekaan may know this, may tell PCs?

- How does everyone else react to Towersfall
  - Koschei: King Cold is told to withdraw pending an unbroken tower
  - Ukpik: impressed by the fight, willing to consider negotiations
  - The Traitor: getting rushed into marriage to Prince of Crows, no time to think on consequences?
  - Caine: impressed by the fight, continues quiet support from background via Cienfuegos
  - Oilester: wild card
    - did he learn of this in time to take advantage, raiding Uhlinberg's remains while the PCs fought the demons?
    - or does he show up in Hart and collect demons for his own army?
    - how lucid is he about the fronts of this war? can he identify the demon tower as the queen's work? is he a potential TTPC ally? who could tell?
  - Grey Eye: increasing attacks against the wizards per Queen's orders tips his hands, giving PCs a lead (via RW Int?)
  - Tsarina: Holy Warrior Priestess of Law is out in full force
  - Wizards are an infighting mess over this?
    - Royal Wizards: firmly aligned with Tsarina and PCs on this
  - Thieves Guilds & nobles are suddenly wary of their alignment with Queen?
  - The Three: ???
  - Other Icons: ???

- Gallows wondered out loud which Demon Lord she was in league with, we should reward that with info soon
  - How would Ghadri or Yedder discover this?
  - Do the goblins tell them this?



## Soon
- Tokra: a circle of changeling witches which refuse to turn hag, and who fight the hags secretly
  - A source of hag lore, plot hooks, and maybe some magic?
  - PCs are introduced by Uncle Ivan the witch
  - This needs to happen in a separate game from the one with the goblins

- Ducal council rumblings
  - 10 total (9 currently), current ruler breaks ties, meaning she had thin lock (5v5) before and now doesn't
  - State of war and country is not great
  - Seryy and Tsarina are against alliance with the Exilarchy of Air thanks to PCs / Royal Wizards
    - Tsarina
    - Tsesarevich Seryy Anton Kuznetsov the Longshot of Rovenk Margrave
    - Grand Duke Markus Venceslav Pasternak of Orarfutaqia Margrave is Caine: not for Tsarina, but against Queen
    - Grand Duke Grisha Gusev of Amjarsuaq Margrave loves Royal Wizards, dislikes Amjarsuaq elves
    - ~~Grand Duke Stanislav Fedorov of Bereria Margrave~~ is newly deceased thanks to curse, appointing new one will take time
  - others (who?) are calling for an alliance with Exilarchy
    - Grand Duke Å½arko Yuriy Kuznetsov of Drutk Margrave is influenced by wife and mother-in-law, hates own family
    - Grand Duchess Zvezdana Diana Kuznetsov of Bebia Margrave dislikes Seryy, has established ties
    - Grand Duke Afonasei Sergeev of Musdarbat Margrave dislikes / hates Royal Wizards, dislikes The Church
  - On the fence but tempted toward anti-Tsarina side
    - Grand Duke Modest Sokolov of Khujunfu Margrave dislikes Royal Wizards
    - Grand Duke Esfir Vyacheslav Kohut of Inech County wants to give up and join before its too late
  - Someone is gonna leak Seryy's wife's infertility, causing vote to force him out of his Margrave and thus off council (who/when?)
    - Ideal for Queen result is that the succession be given to Agnessa, which tips the council heavily in her favor (5v3)
    - If that works, eventually the Exilarchy folks will call for a forced succession

- Alter Ego subplot for Dylan
  - The trigger is Prince of Crows releasing the retconned wizards, including Abstemious
  - Reveal that his cohort and cohort's cohort were assigned to him by RW Int due to his false identification with old school mates
  - Abstemious does what to who in the Arcanists guild?
  - End-game option: merge with Abstemious (becoming human true neutral Arcanist w/ bad rep) or kill him (remain construct Sorcerer)
  - Use the quick-swap ability from Arcanist to maximum effect?

- Royal Wizards Intelligence (RW Int) starts to figure out just how fucked it is?
  - Might give them reason to support surrender to the hobgoblin rebellion?
  - Do they have good contingencies for this? Maaaaybe?
  - Does this explain why Mayhem is away so often? He's working with them now?


## Endgame
- We're 2/3 of the way through the game, time to start revealing plot points more boldly

- https://gnomestew.com/how-to-have-an-epic-campaign-in-three-acts-part-3-of-3/
  - Bring back memorable NPCs
    - TODO: run through the adventure logs, see who looks good
  - Why did it come to this? Recap the cassus belli, maybe w/ escaped NPCs
    - The Queen loses the war with Mezovy a thousand years ago, swears she'll reclaim throne
    - Her agents have been hiding and destroying wizardly knowledge for generations
    - PCs found out, but were too weird and disloyal to be broadly listened to
    - The goblins are in some sort of cryptic rebellion, which accelerated her plans
    - The Queen is going to use demons to beat goblins and Mezovy into submission in exchange for soul tithes thereafter
  - NPCs start losing hope, to emphasize bleakness of situation
    - Things start coming apart for the Empire
    - Citizen rebellions spurred by the Yutch
    - Loss of the Duke of Bereria
    - RW Int knows how bad the current situation stands
  - Climactic battle needs chaotic setting (larger battle, interesting terrain, etc)
  - Blow something up at the end 
    - The Queen's Palace?
    - the Empire?
    - the Spellweb?
    - all of the above?


# Regular considerations
- [B-plot progress](b-plot.md)
- [Rolobo's library](locations/castle.gm.md)
- Followers
  - Dylan
    - High level spy in Tsarina's court
    - Two first levels on each sibling (the ones at Puryev have been blown)
    - One first level at each tower
    - Twenty first level scouts on river and road from Velerolobo to Prolichica
    - 10ish exploring looking for artifact in the fae lands
  - Kat
    - Most protecting the trod forts (Faceplant, Redcap L3)
    - Some watching the 4th tower
    - Some watching the Painted Glen portals
  - Gallows
    - Goblins and others, scouting the trods, preparing to infiltrate hobgoblins
- Allies
  - Royal Wizard spies: looking in the library, or provide +2 for aid another
  - Raaginald
    - Hinnton
    - Whisper network
    - High-level rogue in Tsarina's Court
    - Making overtures to Queen?


# Pacing/Timing
- Target CR is currently 18/17/16 (ACL+5 if 6+ PCs, ACL+4 if 4-5, ACL+3 if 3 PCs)
- Target is 4.5 levels per year for next two years
- PCs encounter Queen for first time around 12th or 13th level?
- PCs confront Queen at 17th or 18th level
- Meta: Prep one scene or one round of big combat for every 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay




# Further ideas
- Desired Scenes / Encounters
  - Hobgoblin (Mongol) tactics vs Mezovian (European) tactics
  - Confronting The Queen. Could involve digs about ghoul Illuminati?
  - Confrontation with Anatoli the Abstemious
  - Second encounter with the Mad Archmage
  - Two confrontations with Kat's villains. These need bigger consequences, work with her to plan them out. Easiest is "PCs prevent a bad alliance between them".
  - The Traitor is revealed
  - Gahdri raised to Ipsissimus
  - Raag achieves success in business
- Minotaurs made from eating the flying aurochs
- The conscription orders have been getting slaves, and now the PCs are getting complained to by slave-owners (whups, you didn't know?)
- So where is The Queen's father? He lies dead asleep and dreaming in his underwater house. She's merely the Princess Regent there.
  - Could have a Nanny Ogg wakes C'thulu subplot if the PCs want
- Female drow witches can become hags without hagbinding, if they want
  - Drow witches are the ultimate progenitors of hags, via this process
  - Drow blood might substitute for changeling blood, which can substitute (at some penalty) for hag blood
  - Elf blood might also work, at even greater penalty (e.g. takes more of it, or ritual is at minuses)
  - Ritual which allows it shares elements with the ritual to make hobgoblins
  - This replaces Lolth with hags and witch Patrons, which implies she is one (on Shadow?)
    - Damhan: CG spidery goddess of destiny and artistry, kinda like Arachne + Athena
- Plane of air
  - https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Plane_of_Air
  - Required beating the Djinn
    - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie/djinni/
    - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding/
    - https://www.aonprd.com/MagicGenieSeals.aspx
    - Can't actually grant Wish spells, just willing to work their way to freedom
  - Also silver/white/cloud dragons
- Plane of Shadow
  - Thematically more aligned with evil outer planes? Dislike
  - Astral corresponds to neutral (both types)?
  - Both order and chaos can access Shadow (ala Amber)?
- How old is The Queen and her hegemony? She doesn't have to have been young when she met Rolobo . . .
  - Older explains her investment, her deeper power base, and her slower movement overall
  - How many generations is 1000 years ago for dwarves (25) and elves (9)? 9 human gen ago was 1842, 25 was 1522.
- How do the ghouls tie into this?
  - They seem natural allies for the Queen, but may have ideological or power-hungry reasons to fight against. 
  - Are they Illuminati behind the Mezovian throne? Yes.
  - Why do they support the current Tsarina? 
    - She is bidable and fecund, ensuring continuity of rule.
    - She is bellicose which produces lots of bodies to feast upon.
    - They didn't really care, because it didn't matter until recently. Now they do, and may be weighing in on the succession.
    - How do they influence the Ducal Court now that it's been established
- Dylan believes they're being scryed upon: not yet, but sooooon
- The Queen has also collected several other types of portal magic
  - Magic mirror portals which can be moved, linking back to the Hall of Mirrors: expensive, harder to make
- Goblin pikey merchant, selling (goblin) dog meat: "d'ya like dags?"
- Map bits
  - Rombordean Fault: small zone in Yutesh, WTF?
    - Caused by Earthquake spell during Vogovan wars?
  - Krimeshian Conspiracy: very close to Styerrabrae, connected to Krimeshian invasion in Arthia, WTF?
  - Newceston Eruption: volcano, connected to Robert's home country via Plane of Fire?
- [Unrelated plot-A, so it's not all "shit the Queen stirred up directly"](random%20crap.md)
- When the going gets desperate, the Tsarina will start conscripting slaves en-mass
- An army can move through a 20ft portal at roughly 1000 troops per minute
- What's with all the birds and bird names
  - [The Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(play)) references: Nephelokokkygia aka Cloud-Cookoo-Land
  - Maybe one of the more prevalent planes creators is a bird fae
  - Maybe birds and elves/fae/drow are connected somehow
  - The Sea Tsar is a very "turn into birds" story
  - [Language of the birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)
  - The Queen is ruler of the planes of Air and Shadow, birds would be prevalent in the former
- You put https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Kladenets over the mantle in the first act, you have to use it in the third
- Mayhem, False and True
  - Coven of hags ([winter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/winter-hag/), [blood](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-blood/), [night](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-night/)) CR 11 (-1 due to favorable circumstances of Mayhem distracting if 5- PCs)
  - Made a Simulacrum of Mayhem, which the PCs catch coming with all his gear to kill Seryy
  - Mayhem convinced them it was a good idea to send him that way, to tip off the PCs
  - He's already gotten some info on the Queen and her plot, but he needs a rescue to deliver it
- Fae folk piloting warforged-like mech-suits against humans
- Versatile Summon Monster + Mad Monkeys: more fun than a structure fire full of monkeys? (Not RAW, not unbalancing)

## Maybe Not
- Cloudkill but w/ weed/mushroom trip, blown by a Catepillar fae w/ a hookah
- More goblins want to surrender to the TTPCs?
- Two villainous groups seeking the same item in the same dungeon as the characters are
- Falkor as a denizen of the Plane of Air

# Product?
What would a product look like?
- What time era? 
  - Current era has a bolus of information, but is also very path dependent
  - Next generation would allow more input from others
- Game system
  - Pathfinder is super heavy-weight, but is the system we used
  - 13th Age is super-light, doesn't share all of the DNA with Pathfinder
  - Some mix of both? Carry forward the useful bits from Pathfinder into 13th Age?
    - Difference between Wizards and Witches
    - Magic item creation as important plot point
    - Create Demiplane + Ritual Magic for permanence
- Codex Praestabilis Bruma turns magic into ritual only?
  - Turns this into Chosen (Sharpe's + Ars Magica)
  - All magic becomes ritual
    - Only take the spell's usage each round, so other actions are still possible (maybe even fighting, for "quick" spells)
    - d3+1 rounds for quick -> 14+ save 2nd round, 11+ 3rd round, automatic 4th round (preserves mystery if it matters)
    - d4 minutes/quarter-hours/hours -> 16+ save 1st time interval, and then as above (if necessary to preserve mystery)
  - Gather Power works on the next spell, but makes you visible until casting is completed
