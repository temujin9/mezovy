# TODO
- Yarik

- TTPC next game news/events
  - Diego comes back from further negotiations in Seryy's court
  - Queen already started overtures to the guild in Hinnton
  - Spy news:
    - Dylan's
      - High level spy in Tsarina's court
        - Learns details about Tsarina's possible agreement with Yutch?
      - Two first levels on each sibling (the ones at Puryev have been blown)
        - Learns about The Traitor having a weird reclusive elven visitor
      - One first level at each tower
        - Learns news about Marduke Marcus' protection of Sioraneq from hobgoblins, taking of its lord as hostage
      - Twenty first level scouts on river and road from Velerolobo to Prolichica
        - Further news of The Black's agents?
    - Kat's
    - Who else? Raag? Gahdri?
  - Allies deliver information
    - Royal Wizards were looking in the library
    - Maybe Alaric has capstoned Knowledge: History?
  - Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier - NPCs from the lands return broken by war, and Queen asks for fresh regiments

- The Tsarina
  - Much more worried about losing lands to the southwest, is launching a counter-assault there

- The Three
  - The Blue is making enquiries about royal flowers to the local magisters in his guild, ???, ???, and ???
    - Does this raise attention of Dylan's spies?
  - The Black is putting out feelers in thieves guild to Prolichica, Auseq, and Sioraneq territories (with help from Blue on transport)
    - Sending goods through trods to Singuit & Qilissuitsip, pretending it's the company's ship sending them
  - The Mithral is exploring the Yutchland mountain-way to Athamberingia
    - This alerts the Yutch, no doubt


# Pacing/Timing
- Target CR is 13/12/11 (ACL+5 if 6+ PCs, ACL+4 if 4-5, ACL+3 if 3 PCs)
- Target is 4.5 levels per year for next two years
- PCs encounter Queen for first time around 11/2022 at 12th or 13th level
- PCs confront Queen around 11/2023 at 17th or 18th level
- Meta: Prep one scene or one round of big combat for every 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay




# Further ideas
- How do the ghouls tie into this?
  - They seem natural allies for the Queen, but may have ideological or power-hungry reasons to fight against. 
  - Are they Illuminati behind the Mezovian throne? Yes.
  - Why do they support the current Tsarina? 
    - She is bidable and fecund, ensuring continuity of rule.
    - She is bellicose which produces lots of bodies to feast upon.
    - They didn't really care, because it didn't matter until recently. Now they do, and may be weighing in on the succession.
- Dylan believes they're being scryed upon: not yet, but sooooon
- Desired Scenes / Encounters
  - Goblin artificer delivers a Hannibal Lecture. May lead to negotiation w/ Ukpik.
  - Navigating the Goblin Market. Need ways to force this: air patrols and Teleport Traps.
  - Confronting The Queen. Could involve digs about ghoul Illuminati?
  - Hobgoblin (Mongol) tactics vs Mezovian (European) tactics
  - Gahdri raised to Ipsissimus
  - Confrontation with Anatoli the Abstemious
  - Second encounter with the Mad Archmage
  - (x2) confrontations with Kat's villains. These need bigger consequences, work with her to plan them out. Easiest is "PCs prevent a bad alliance between them".
  - The Traitor is revealed
  - Raag achieves success in business
- Woods battle with shields used as a bridge
- Helpful rebel changelings ala the Tokra
- Cloudkill but w/ weed/mushroom trip, blown by a Catepillar fae w/ a hookah

    Grab & Swallow Whole on bite, breath weapon as a green (cone), swap swim and fly speed, wing buffet attacks are now piercing (shell)
  - Target CR > PCL+5: CR 18+ @ PCL 13+
    - The bigger threat the Queen blocks their counter-attack with while setting up Tower of Fear
    - Ergo after her position in the whole thing is revealed
  - Tarasque legends:
    - Six limbs, lion's mane, tail attack, spiny shell, noxious gas, swallowing people, destroying ships
    - old song evoking older guardian beast (Lagadigadèu is probably just a non-lexical vocable)
      Lagadigadèu, The tarasque, The tarasque
      Lagadigadèu, The tarasque of the Chateau
      Let her go by, The old witch
      Let her go by, For she's going to dance!
    - a guardian beast of the town before Christianization?
    - defeated by pacification by a saint, can we play off that?
  - Charmed and Plane Shifted in by the Queen to attack a wizard tower (Uhlinberg) allied with the PCs
    "You have refused and spurned the gifts of the eldar? Very well, we return the gift of the wizards to you."
- Falkor as a denizen of the Plane of Air
- The Queen has also collected several other types of portal magic
  - Magic mirror portals which can be moved, linking back to the Hall of Mirrors: expensive, harder to make
- Everyone's got combatus interruptus, which isn't good for stability
  - Companies from some areas had foraged despite dictates from the palace not to, inflaming internecine passions
  - Harvests are going poorly this year due to lack of manpower, foraging

- [Unrelated plot-A, so it's not all "shit the Queen stirred up directly"](random%20crap.md)
- When the going gets desperate, the Tsarina will start conscripting slaves en-mass
- The Treasurer witch knows the value of the library
  - Are they (he and minor rakshasa familiar) aligned with the witchlords?

- What's with all the birds and bird names
  - [The Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(play)) references: Nephelokokkygia aka Cloud-Cookoo-Land
  - Maybe one of the more prevalent planes creators is a bird fae
  - Maybe birds and elves/fae/drow are connected somehow
  - The Sea Tsar is a very "turn into birds" story
  - [Language of the birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)
  - The Queen is ruler of the planes of Air and Shadow, birds would be prevalent in the former
- Corrupt or complicate PC plans
- Force PCs against The Queen early, trying to prevent the permanent tower of fear

- You put https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Kladenets over the mantle in the first act, you have to use it in the third
- Mayhem, False and True
  - Coven of hags ([winter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/winter-hag/), [blood](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-blood/), [night](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-night/)) CR 11 (-1 due to favorable circumstances of Mayhem distracting if 5- PCs)
  - Made a Simulacrum of Mayhem, which the PCs catch coming with all his gear to kill Seryy
  - Mayhem convinced them it was a good idea to send him that way, to tip off the PCs
  - He's already gotten some info on the Queen and her plot, but he needs a rescue to deliver it
- Fae folk piloting warforged-like mech-suits against humans
- Versatile Summon Monster + Mad Monkeys: more fun than a structure fire full of monkeys? (Not RAW, not unbalancing)

# Product?
What would a product look like?
- What time era? 
  - Current era has a bolus of information, but is also very path dependent
  - Next generation would allow more input from others
- Game system
  - Pathfinder is super heavy-weight, but is the system we used
  - 13th Age is super-light, doesn't share all of the DNA with Pathfinder
  - Some mix of both? Carry forward the useful bits from Pathfinder into 13th Age?
    - Difference between Wizards and Witches
    - Magic item creation as important plot point
    - Create Demiplane + Ritual Magic for permanence
- The Codex of Ice
