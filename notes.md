  - Gang of spellcasters ready to duel-bully Gahdri: Delver (blindfighting), Bestial Arcanist (shapeshifter), [Lady Frost](lady%20frost.md)

- The Treasurer witch knows the value of the library
  - Are they (he and minor rakshasa familiar) aligned with the witchlords? 
  - Probably not, or the PCs would already be fuckered
  - Unless he had no idea what he was getting in there, and/or hasn't admitted his failure
  - So they are part of a Thieves' Guild, maybe? Which one? One who's pocketed a wizards guild?
- An army can move through a 20ft portal at roughly 1000 troops per minute
- What's with all the birds and bird names
  - [The Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(play)) references: Nephelokokkygia aka Cloud-Cookoo-Land
  - Maybe one of the more prevalent planes creators is a bird fae
  - Maybe birds and elves/fae/drow are connected somehow

  - [Language of the birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)
- Corrupt or complicate PC plans
  - Raag wants a halfling enclave / thieves guild
    - Everyone sees it coming because halflings have a larcenous reputation
    - Lurko should double-hate this, because he wants an honorable one
  - Lurko want a brainwashing school for goblins run by Inquisitor and dragons
    - They also hate the written word, and -love- fire (which is bad for silver dragons)
    - They grow up to be hobgoblins if you feed them right (or bugbears if they get too much sentient meat)
- Force PCs against The Queen early, trying to prevent the permanent tower of fear
  - Trash them utterly, but try not to kill them, and do let them escape
- Humans stole the Inuk goblinoids thunderbolt iron, leading to their conquest by the fae folk (ala Robert Peary and the Inuit)

  - Made a Simulacrum of Mayhem, which the PCs catch coming with all his gear to kill Seryy
  - Mayhem convinced them it was a good idea to send him that way, to tip off the PCs
  - He's already gotten some info on the Queen and her plot, but he needs a rescue to deliver it

# Armies:
- Mezovy - 40k
  - ala Catherine the Great v Turks - ~125K peak of 125M population / 3
  - 55 provinces, total pop 4.1M @ 1% recruitment
  - She brings ~20% to bear in Rovenk: 8k
  - 370 the PCs already have (3 medium, 1 small, 2 diminutive)
- Ukpik - 8k/9k now, 25k/60k later, peak of 3.7M population
  - ala Genghis - 20k/30k now (Mohi & Western Xia), ~75/180k (Kwarizm & Xia II) peak of 110M population / 3
  - Early advantage goes to Ukpik, who has a novel interplanar highway for armies
  - These conquests may allow him to swell his armies with human troops
  - 60% cavalry archers/40% heavy cavalry
  - Followers: 264 = 220/22/11/5/3/2/1
    - 7th has a larger tumen (colossal core army, 2k, plus 1k from 8 zuut, 20 aravt, 20 spies)
    - Five 5th-6th each have a tumen (colossal core army, 2k, plus 800 from 6 zuut, 20 aravt, 16 spies)
    - 38 2nd-4th have a zuut (medium army, 100), often 2 or 5 merged (large or huge army, 200-500)
    - 120 1st have a aravt (diminutive army, 10), usually 10 merged with zuut (large army, 200)
    - 100 1st are spies (usage/rules TBD)
    - 3x headed to Rovenk (7th, 6th, 5th, 8.6k), 3x conquering trods (6th, 2x 5th, 8.4k)
  - Tribes:
    - Elite beast-riders ride individualized monstrous stuff TBD
    - Ulus: ride horses
      - The most common of the hobgoblin types, as they have the most land space to grow in
      - Immiscible w/ goblins: "few things inspire their wrath more than [...] horses (who frighten goblins tremendously)"
      - Treat non-horse-riders as conquered levies (e.g. Xia chinese), not main part of troops
      - They gain the most benefit from some Mongol tactics (long march, live off land, looting horses)
    - Inuk: ride dire wolf & bat ("Wooooolf! BAAAAATS!")
      - Several other groups have taken up the bat, for air support and to imitate Ukpik
    - Nawatli: ride axe-beaks
    - Wargs: troops in their own right, only carry goblins
    - Goblins: ride goblin dogs
    - Goblin-borne hobgoblins and bugbears: usually avoid horses, picking up other tribes choices
- Vasilisa - 17k
  - ala Ireland during 1798 rebellion - 50k, peak of 4.7M population / 3
  - Followers: 12800 ~= 7800+1200+800+800+600+1600
  - +4000 non-Followers: ~1/4 of the army
  - Vile gives penalties (how much?) to Loyalty checks if not a Follower
  - Got the edges of preparation, entrenchment, more equipment, and subversion
  - This subversion may allow her to swell her armies with human troops


# Mass combat
- Upsize the armies, so mass combat lasts multiple rounds
  - Mounts (BP = Mount’s ACR): The army is mounted on horses or other war-trained animals. Increase its OM and DV by 2, and increase its Consumption by 1. If your army uses mounts that are more powerful than the units themselves, your army’s ACR and derived scores might increase (see ACR). To purchase this resource, a settlement in your kingdom must have a Foreign Quarter, Stable, or Stockyard.
  - Ranged Weapons (2 BP): The army is equipped with ranged weapons (such as crossbows, slings, or bows), gaining ranged attack capability. Increase its Consumption by 1.
- Work out how to have individual PCs on the battlefield
    PC 7 = ACR 1/4
    PC 10 = ACR 2
- Figure out how to treat ships: 
  - Fortification = hardness + 4 (moats, unsiegable, negated by boarding)
  - ?x siege engines => 4x would reduce enemy warship to 0 fort on average
    - Longship => 4 Large, Sailing ship => 24 Large, Warship => 26/23? Large
    - 15bp => 60kgp (or 7500gp?) => 120 (or 15?) light ballista (not counting ammo)
  - Can hold any army between crew size and crew + passengers size
  - Usually using Withdraw to stay at Ranged
  - Melee means it's a boarding action
