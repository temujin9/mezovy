    - Raag was looking to prevent this, maybe he gets word in time?

    - Ergo this shouldn't get to them until closer to the end
  - TTPCs learn that the Queen plans to make another Tower
    - This time with unbreakable CL and core which can be reopened from inside (w/ a no-magic one as an "airlock")
    - PCs need to know this is coming, so they can try to prevent it and so the drumbeat can be started
  - TTPCs chase the Queen through her castle and defeat her

- Tokra-expies are a circle of changeling witches which refuse to turn hag, and who fight the hags secretly
  - A source of hag lore, plot hooks, and maybe some magic
  - PCs are introduced by Uncle Ivan the witch
  - This needs to happen in a separate game from the one with the goblin negotiations

- Alter Ego subplot for Dylan
  - The trigger is Prince of Crows releasing the retconned wizards, including Abstemious
  - Reveal that his cohort and cohort's cohort were assigned to him by RWInt due to his false identification with old school mates
  - Abstemious does what to who in the Arcanists guild?
  - End-game option: merge with Abstemious (becoming human true neutral Arcanist w/ bad rep) or kill him (remain construct Sorcerer)
  - Use the quick-swap ability from Arcanist to maximum effect?

- Plane of air
  - https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Plane_of_Air

    - https://www.aonprd.com/MagicGenieSeals.aspx
    - Can't actually grant Wish spells, just willing to work their way to freedom
  - Also silver/white/cloud dragons

- Plane of Shadow
  - Thematically more aligned with evil outer planes? Dislike
  - Both order and chaos could use Shadow travel (ala Amber)?
  - Cosmologically this is the borderlands between negative material plane and Material
  - Underdark is the heavy overlap between this and the plane of earth / the Material?

- The Queen has also collected several other types of portal magic
  - Magic mirror portals which can be moved, linking back to the Hall of Mirrors: expensive, harder to make
  - Elf doors ala that one animated Netflix TV show (also used in Athamberingia

- You put https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Kladenets over the mantle in the first act, you have to use it in the third

  - old D&D joke

  - https://cohost.org/chrisb/post/5319118-i-recently-had-a-con
    1d6   Encounter
    1-3   2d6 goblins hunting bears.
    4-5   An injured bear.
    6     Roland, King of the Bears, with 1d6 armoured bear retainers, hunting goblins.

- Goblins and PCs *could* force a drow revolt against The Queen
  - She's a thousand-plus years old and hasn't leveled appreciably? She started out nearly this strong in backstory?
  - She's obligated to punish failure, and also doomed if she punishes too much (20%)
  - She's can punish a few times before killing, and kill sparingly, but it still adds up
  - 20% of 9368 is 1874, x3 is 5622 total failures and punishments, if she last leveled 500 years ago that's 1/month or less, 1 death/quarter
  - Current situation may have increased that base rate considerably ... and she doesn't have a meter to watch



# Later/Background/Maybe Not
- Elf blood makes goblins into hobgoblins
  - If Ter Khrekaan learns the full relationship between drow and hags, he will have an "only really need elf blood" realization
  - This is the final part of the puzzle that he needs: hobgoblins could then farm from any elven population, not just the hags & changelings
  - This tips the balance solidly toward hobgoblin victory, as they can finally massively overpopulate from goblin ranks

- Who freed the wayang from the book? It takes a Miracle / another 9th level splash
  - They bought a scroll from The Shepherd? Means scrolls of Wish are on the table.
  - Many of Jerry's NPC friends helped in a ceremonial casting? Means a ritual of debinding / Wish is on the table.
  - The Wayang is a devotee of anti-Lolth, she got him out? Means praying for a Miracle is on the table.
  - A weak bit of all of the above managed to crack him, maybe in stages?
  - A deity (Veles? anti-Lolth?) broke him out of their own accord for their own purposes?

- The Towers are an infighting mess over Towersfall
  - Half are well aligned with the Tsarina, half sneering at them through prejudice or misinformation
  - All are occupied with dispelling the Curse Land
  - Royal Wizards - Cannon Fodder - for, firmly aligned with Tsarina and PCs on this
  - Uhlinberg - Ditchdiggers - for, but reduced to beggars with rich purses, which they wish to protect from other guilds
  - Topolh - Snowballs - for, Rovenk is in their territory
  - Maskar - Dusky Snobs - for, loves Royal Family
  - Prolichica - Shopkeeps - for, dislikes Royal Wizards, but royals just repudiated The Queen
  - Daydah - Mummers - against, hate Royal Family and Royal Wizards
  - Sioraneq - Brouhahas - against, secretly sympathizers with The Queen
  - Oreskoere - Gravediggers - against, loves Daydah and agrees with them
  - Polyn - Sheepsquints - against, dislikes the Church
  - Auseq - Vagrants - against, dislikes Daydah but hates the Church

- Ducal council rumblings
  - 10 total (9 currently), current ruler breaks ties, meaning she had thin lock (5v5) before and now doesn't
  - State of war and country is not great, at all
  - Seryy and Tsarina are against alliance with the Exilarchy of Air thanks to PCs / Royal Wizards
    - Tsarina
    - Tsesarevich Seryy Anton Kuznetsov the Longshot of Rovenk Margrave
    - Grand Duke Markus Venceslav Pasternak of Orarfutaqia Margrave is Caine: not for Tsarina, but against Queen
    - Grand Duke Grisha Gusev of Amjarsuaq Margrave loves Royal Wizards, dislikes Amjarsuaq elves
    - ~~Grand Duke Stanislav Fedorov of Bereria Margrave~~ is newly deceased thanks to curse, appointing new one will take time
  - others (who?) are calling for an alliance with Exilarchy
    - Grand Duke Žarko Yuriy Kuznetsov of Drutk Margrave is influenced by wife and mother-in-law, hates own family
    - Grand Duchess Zvezdana Diana Kuznetsov of Bebia Margrave dislikes Seryy, has established ties
    - Grand Duke Afonasei Sergeev of Musdarbat Margrave dislikes / hates Royal Wizards, dislikes The Church
  - On the fence but tempted toward anti-Tsarina side
    - Grand Duke Modest Sokolov of Khujunfu Margrave dislikes Royal Wizards
    - Grand Duke Esfir Vyacheslav Kohut of Inech County wants to give up and join before its too late
  - Someone is gonna leak Seryy's wife's infertility, causing vote to force him out of his Margrave and thus off council (who/when?)
    - Ideal for Queen result is that the succession be given to Agnessa, which tips the council heavily in her favor (5v3)
    - If that works, eventually the Exilarchy folks will call for a forced succession
  - How do the ghouls tie into this?
    - They are Illuminati behind the Mezovian throne
    - They idly supported the current Tsarina because she is bidable, has ensured succession, and the war was producing a feast
    - They didn't really care much beforehand, because it didn't threaten the realm until more recently
    - The Ghastly Ecclesiarch is trying to decide whether it's better to let to let The Queen win

- Minotaurs made from eating the flying aurochs

- So where is The Queen's father? He lies dead asleep and dreaming in his underwater house. She's merely the Princess Regent there.
  - Could have a Nanny Ogg wakes C'thulu subplot if the PCs want

- Female drow witches can become hags without hagbinding, if they want
  - Drow witches are the ultimate progenitors of hags, via this process
  - Drow blood might substitute for changeling blood, which can substitute (at some penalty) for hag blood
  - Regular elf blood also works, at even greater penalty (e.g. takes more of it, or ritual is at minuses)
  - Ritual which allows it shares elements with the ritual to make hobgoblins
  - This replaces Lolth with hags and witch Patrons, which implies she is one (on Shadow?)
    - Damhan: CG spidery goddess of destiny and artistry, kinda like Arachne + Athena
    - Oh hey is this the spider deity that wove the spellweb? Makes magic and trickery her domains as well.

- What's with all the birds and bird names
  - [The Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(play)) references: Nephelokokkygia aka Cloud-Cookoo-Land
  - Maybe one of the more prevalent planes creators is a bird fae
  - Maybe birds and elves/fae/drow are connected somehow
  - The Sea Tsar is a very "turn into birds" story
  - [Language of the birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)
  - The Queen is ruler of the planes of Air and Shadow, birds would be prevalent in the former

- Fae folk piloting warforged-like mech-suits against humans

- (Downton Abbey) Violet Crawley 
  [Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham](https://downtonabbey.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Crawley#Quotes) 
  - Lawful evil, wields a mean cane, very important and can't be killed lawfully
  - Powerful estate, important leaders during the war footing, but generally behind the times
  - Servants a snooping, secrets and intrigues a plenty
  - Do about half a generation earlier (e.g. she's less decrepit, her son is younger and less self-assured)

- Doctor Who
  - Powerful wizards fighting interdimensional wars that impinge on humanity
  - "Anchoring of the thread" throwing out irrational forces, establishing history
  - It's bigger on the inside and all that
  - _Might_ come up with Abstemious

- (Mac the Knife) MacHeath the Drow Assassin
